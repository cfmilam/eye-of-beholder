<h2 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h2>
<p>
Neville Vivian (Viv) Pope (b.22/01/31) is a Philosophy graduate of the University of Wales with a particular interest in philosophy of physics. As a young telephone lineman he corresponded with Albert Einstein and also extensively with the philosophers Gilbert Ryle, Alfred Ayer, Karl Popper and the scientist Herman Bondi, among others. This led him to entering university as a mature student, graduating with Honours in 1969. On leaving university he became a lecturer in Liberal Studies and Adult Education at Burton-on-Trent College of Further Education. He was also tutor in Logic and the History of Science, as well as serving as Study Centre Co-ordinator for the Open University. In 1975, while editor of a Philosophy journal he spent some weeks at CERN, the atomic research centre in Geneva, where he had talks with the scientists John Bell, V. Weisskopf, and T. D. Lee. Later, in order to concentrate on his philosophical researches, he took early retirement from his teaching posts. After retiring, he continued to pursue his researches as an honorary associate of the Department of Mathematics at Keele University, where he still collaborates with Dr. A. D. Osborne and also with members of the Physics Department at the University of Wales, Swansea. For many years, he has been a member of ANPA (the Alternative Natural Philosophy Association) at Cambridge, England where he has served as Secretary and Newsletter Editor. He has published many papers on the subjects of relativity and quantum theory and advocates a radically new approach to these still contentious theories. He is presently the Director of POAMS, a group drawn from various academic disciplines with an interest in the Pope-Osborne Angular Momentum Synthesis.

<p>
After the launch of the POAMS (Pope-Osborne Angular Momentum Synthesis) website www.poams.org in 2003, a series of lectures and seminars was arranged. The many interesting and sometimes taxing questions which arose as a consequence of these meetings have led to the production of this monograph. The author wishes to thank Penny Gower, for her hard work and support in organising the meetings. Thanks are due also to those people, few of whom are qualified in physics or philosophy, who nevertheless posed the penetrating commonsense questions that have prompted him to produce this work.
</p>
<p>
One of the main aims of this text will be to present some very intricate arguments in the plainest possible language, without recourse to either the customary in-group scientific and philosophical jargon or to any condescending attempt at the 'dumbing down' of abstruse professional arguments. The level aimed at is that of ordinary commonsense intelligence, which we rate more highly than is customary in circles of professional science. In other words, the aim of this monograph is, as it were, to put the claims of modern theorists before a jury of ordinary, sane and intelligent non-specialists, the sorts of people who are usually entrusted, in even the most difficult of instances, to judge the merits or demerits of a case. It is also pointed out that although some mathematical formulae have had to be included in these pages, these equations are very simple, and that while an understanding of the argument may be enhanced by a knowledge of mathematics, these mathematical details need not prevent non-mathematicians from judging the argument as a whole on the basis of pure commonsense logic.
</p>
<p>
This argument will be that certain trends in modern physics reveal that the original scientific conception of nature as a great and determinate machine is now gradually giving way to a view of nature as a vast, interactive, informational matrix, or hologram. As might be expected, this will require radical revisions in some of our most basic and all-too-familiar, traditional ways of thinking about nature. Not least, it should point the need for us, as logically minded custodians of commonsense, to keep a watchful eye on the theoretical excesses of our scientists.

<h2 id="i-introduction" class="chapter-title">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>
There are many sciences and scientific theories but there is only one nature. Why, then, during our Science's more than two thousand years of evolution, have its representations of nature become so increasingly fragmented? Something must be wrong, and seriously wrong, somewhere.
</p>
<p>
Explanations may abound as to just what it is that has gone wrong. In these pages we leave such explanations to the historical analyst and ask ourselves a more fundamental question: What is the most basic, most commonly acceptable definition of a science of nature that is possible? And what else can that most basic definition of science be but that it is the rational interpretation of observational and instrumental information? And what, other than ourselves, both directly and in communication with others like ourselves, is the ultimate reader of that information? Right at its very start, therefore, science is relativistic, which is to say that whatever it describes as existing in nature is described and measured relatively to observation.
</p>
<p>
Right at that same relativistic root lies also the fact that scientific information is quantised. This follows from the fact that for information to be information, its ultimate elements, or informational bits, have to be discrete and unconnected. If there were laws determining what letters of the alphabet, or sounds in speech 'caused' them to appear next to one another in this sentence, all sentences would be the same as this one and there would be no such thing as news. That is to say, to be in any way informative, these sequences of informational elements have to be probabilistic, not determinate. In the jargon of Information Technology, they have to be stochastic [from the Greek <em>stokhazesthai</em>, to aim at, or conjecture (<em>stokhos</em> meaning a target)].
</p>
<p>
And indeed, this is precisely what we find on the most basic level of our contacts with nature, where information, in all sectors of observation, is quantised in this way into discrete events of this very same indeterminate or probabilistic nature. Each such event is a complete and irreducible packet, or quantum, of energy times time, or action, in units of Planck's constant $h$.
</p>
<p>
But if we, as observers, are the readers of this information, then what are its 'writers'? What else can these be but those objects whose informational 'bar-codes' we read with instruments such as the spectrometer. Together with these and other instruments such as the telescope and microscope we can extrapolate, from the information presented in observation — that is, from natural phenomena — all that we know about the distances and directions of objects, their chemical characteristics, their positions and motions in relation to ourselves and to one another, their relative masses — in fact, everything that is known, in science, about what we perceive as physical objects and processes.
</p>
<p>
But of course, all physical events involve time. What is time? Metaphysics aside, what else can time be but what we read with those instruments we call clocks? Some of those objects we extrapolate from observational information are clocks. A clock, in this sense, is a physical process which we arbitrarily choose as a time-standard by which to measure the rates of other processes. Examples of such standards are, historically, the period of the earth's daily rotation or that of the moon around the earth, the earth around the sun, and so on. Moreover, we have regulated mechanisms of the sort that John Harrison constructed in the 18th century, for the express purpose of fixing an arbitrary non-local time-standard such as Greenwich Mean Time for purposes of coordinating railway timetables and plotting the positions of ships at sea. This notion of a 'global time', or time that is the same everywhere began with the classical scientists, Galileo and Newton. Not only was this time conceived to be the same all over the earth, it was also assumed to extend into the whole universe of matter and space. This universalised or 'absolute' time would be the time ticked by an ideal clock, constructed along Harrison lines, to maintain the same steady rate of ticks regardless of wherever it went in the universe or of how it got there. This observationally unjustified assumption of an underlying absolute, overall time was doomed, however, not to survive the advance of scientific knowledge, for the following reasons.
</p>
<p>
A very good clock, or regular periodic process, is that of the eclipses of Jupiter's principal satellite, Io, as it orbits its parent planet. Olaus Römer, the Danish astronomer, in 1676, was the first to observe that as this clock moves away from the terrestrial observer it loses time and that as it moves towards the observer it gains time. This ratio of distance-change to time-change Römer found to be a constant, $c$, the refined value of which is now 299,792,458 metres to the second.
</p>
<p>
It is at this point in our scientific history, with Römer's discovery of $c$, that classical physics approaches its conceptual 'sell-by date' and modern theoretical physics, for better or worse, begins to take over. The emphasis, here, falls on the word 'theoretical', as applied to a realm of speculative objects and processes that are never directly observed nor are even observable except in what are conceived to be their effects on things actually observed. The first move in this theoretical direction, on the grounds that $c$ has the dimensions of a velocity, was to assume that it is a velocity. But a velocity of what? In this way there immediately arises the theoretical question of what it is, exactly, that is supposed to be moving at this 'velocity $c$'. And, as everyone knows, what was assumed to be moving was 'light', conceived as a travelling intermediary, the conveyor, or retailer of the information by which we observe things.
</p>
<p>
However, conceived in this way, 'light' is purely theoretical. We never see light leave an object and wing its way towards us in order for us to see the object. Nor do we ever see light travelling between one object and another in a pure vacuum, far less in any 'luminiferous ether'. What is commonly regarded, therefore, as the 'fact' that light travels in any sense is not a fact at all but, in the last analysis, just pure supposition.
</p>
<p>
It is from this pure supposition that practically all our modern theories stem as to what it is that is travelling in that completely invisible way and by what invisible means. The quantised character of the observed spectral energies suggests particles, whereas their periodic and resonant character suggests waves. But waves in what? What is there to wave in a vacuum? And what sorts of 'particles' are there that can possibly behave like waves in experimental situations?
</p>
<p>
Theories abound, therefore, as to what it is that conducts these luminous energies from one place to another. Is it some invisible quasi-substance such as a 'wave-particle' — whatever that might be? Do the 'waves' travel in some sort of 'field', or 'ether'? Speculative theories still vie with one another as to what might be the defining properties and characteristics of this assumed light-conveying 'medium'. But despite all attempts to detect and measure these properties, even with the very best instruments that modern technology can devise, empirical science has drawn a blank. In modern physics, all conception of the information we call light as consisting of waves and/or particles, either in vacuo or in some kind of medium, have ended, as they began, as bits of pure theoretical speculation.
</p>
<p>
However, apart from any question of the sheer pragmatical value of this plethora of working-theories in the development of our scientific history, it is a plain fact that this interpretation of $c$ as a 'velocity', which led to the whole theoretical extravaganza, was never logically obligatory. For instance, it does not automatically follow that because all velocities are distances divided by time, all distances divided by time are velocities. I can divide the length of my lawn by the time since the Kennedy assassination, without that signifying any kind of 'velocity'.
</p>

The essential difference is that velocity truly applies to something that is definitely travelling, which, as we have seen, is eminently not the case with $c$. The logical alternative to interpreting $c$ as a 'velocity' is as described by Herman Bondi in his book <em>Assumption and Myth in Physical Theory</em>:<sup class="fn-ref">1</sup>
</p>
<p>
> Any attempt to measure the velocity of light is. . . not an attempt at measuring the velocity of light but an attempt at ascertaining the length of the standard metre in Paris in terms of time-units.
</p>
<p>
This logical alternative to the historical interpretation of $c$ as a 'velocity' marks the point of departure for the whole new ahistorical approach to physics described in this book, an approach which, although it has been around for centuries in the name of 'phenomenalism', has been scarcely more than just hinted at in the chronicles of scientific philosophy. In this alternative approach, the traditional model of the universe as a Great Machine, whose ultimate parts are self-sufficient atoms separated by a self-sufficient vacuum and causally connected by an incidental travelling intermediary called 'light', is replaced by a very different model. This is the model of an informational system in which light, far from being some incidental travelling intermediary between atoms in space, is essentially what is observed in all its direct and instrumental manifestations from below infrared to beyond ultraviolet and gamma. Light, in this all-inclusive sense is therefore the fount of all the information from which all properties and dimensions of objects, of space, time and whatever, are projected — even what we call (or, rather, miscall) the 'velocity of light'. This is the model of an informational system which, in this book, for want of any better description we refer to as a 'hologram'. The distinguishing features and implications of this radically divergent, holistic or 'holographic' approach to physics that is logically implied by the Bondian re-interpretation of $c$ are as described in the following pages.

<h2 id="ii-the-universal-hologram" class="chapter-title">II. The Universal 'Hologram'</h2>
<p>
The word 'hologram', as used in these pages, does not signify, as in the usual, technological language, a 'plate which gives rise to 3D images'. It signifies more of a philosophical concept, in which the emphasis falls on "<em>holo-</em>", meaning whole and in which the dimensions of the optical images are dependent upon the manner in which optical information is observed.
</p>
<p>
Now in light, taking its full spectral range from deepest infrared to farthest ultraviolet and Gamma, is contained all the information there is about the world and our place in it. Even in what, to us are the very darkest of places there is light, albeit light that we, as human observers, can never see. This invisible light consists, fundamentally, of the information that atoms transact with one another, which interrelates them, signalling to each other their relative existence and dispositions in ways well below and above the thresholds of ordinary optical sensation.
</p>
<p>
This is no problem because what we cannot observe with our eyes we may observe with our other senses, such as those of touch, taste, smell and so on. Moreover, in all these different categories of human sensation there are instruments which communicate to our senses what they detect in all their various non-human ways. What we cannot see with our eyes we may therefore perceive in all those ways known to natural science, all of which are based, ultimately, on the same sort of information that we now understand by 'light'.
</p>
<p>
In this all-inclusive sense, then, the word 'light' loses its customary meaning as something ancillary to our knowledge of the world. Its meaning expands to become coextensive with that of the world itself, the matrix of experience into which all scientific knowledge analyses without remainder. In other words, in light as we now understand it — that is, as something directly observed or detected — we have all the information that is both necessary and sufficient for the conduct of science.
</p>
<p>
What we do not have in light is any direct or instrumental information, in any category of sensation or instrumentation, as to what we suppose is the existence and movement of the light in those voids between objects (ultimately, atoms) that we extrapolate from the information contained in the light. Indeed, there is a profound fallacy in supposing that we can ever have information about anything underlying or conveying that information which is not, in itself, information of the same kind.
</p>
<p>
This means that there can be none of those gaps, voids or spaces that we ordinarily think of as separating the ultimate informational bits out of which all space and time are extrapolated. All such gaps or voids are observational projections out of the information. They cannot also be preconditions for the information out of which they are projected.
</p>
<p>
This reverses the traditional priority of conception which puts light in space by putting space — and time, and everything — in the light. There is then no question of light 'travelling at the rate $c$ in vacuo'. The ratio $c$ is simply a dimensional constant in Bondi's sense of a 'conversion factor' for converting our observationally projected measures in conventional metres into conventional measures in seconds, in the way that one might convert measures in pounds into measures in kilograms, or measures in yards into measures in metres. But of course, it is easy to see how one set of units of a measure such as length or weight can be converted into different units of the same measure. It is by no means so easy to see how units of one measure, such as length, can be converted into units of a different measure, such as time. This is because we are long habituated to thinking of length and time as different and independent kinds of measure. We 'naturally' assume that when we are measuring length we are not measuring time, and vice versa. But nature tells us that this assumption was just plain wrong. There never was any distance, in and of itself, nor any time in and of itself. This was simply an illusion, due to the fact that until Römer's astronomical discovery (see above) mankind had never measured distances on such a scale as to reveal that all observational distances are also observational times. The eventual discovery was, in its simplest, non-theoretical terms, that distance was never pure distance, as traditionally imagined, but was always, if only we could have been aware of it, distance-time. In short, from that moment on, what our science has had to adapt to has been the fact that there is no such thing as a pure distance in metres but only an observational distance in which the traditionally distinct measures in metres and measures in seconds are inseparable.
</p>
<p>
In all of this, of course, the stress falls on direct observation. This is fundamentally opposed to the 'God's-eye-view' of an absolute space and an absolute time underlying everything, all direct knowledge of which is impossible except via light, the incidental travelling intermediary between things and our knowledge of them.
</p>
<h2 id="ii1-the-relativity-of-time">II.1 The Relativity of Time</h2>
<p>
A curious logical consequence of this merging of observational distance and time is that objects which travel in space also travel in time. There is a sense in which this statement is obvious, since travelling any distance always takes some measure of time. (No-one has ever travelled from A to B instantly.) However, to say that distance is time is to say that instead of bodies being observed to travel pure distances in metres per second of time, as previously imagined, they travel observational distances in seconds of time per observational second of time. In other words, every $3 \times 10^8$ metres$/c$ that a body travels relatively to the observer is one second of time, regardless of how fast or how slowly it travels.
</p>
<p>
This means that if $t$ is the standard period of a clock when stationary relative to the observer (as seen in the observer's telescope, say) then if, in that standard time $t$, the clock is seen to travel either away from or towards the observer over a distance $s$, the observational resultant $t_o$ of those dimensional components, $t$ and $s/c$ will be (by Pythagoras),<sup class="fn-ref">2</sup>
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$t_o = \sqrt{t^2 + s^2/c^2}$$</div>
<p>
Now since the relative or observational velocity of the object is $v = s/t_o$, then substituting for $s$ in (1) the equivalent expression $vt_o$ produces
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$t_o = \sqrt{(vt_o/c)^2 + t^2}$$</div>
<p>
which simplifies directly to the familiar Einsteinian time-dilational formula
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$t_o = t\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$$</div>
<p>
It will no doubt be noticed that this equivalent of the Einsteinian formula is derived in a manner which is entirely independent of the usual historical way.<sup class="fn-ref">3</sup> That is to say, it is derived not only with the utmost simplicity, as opposed to the notoriously abstruse rationale of Einsteinian relativity that is taught to students but also — and most significantly — without any recourse to the second axiom of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, which states that light travels in a vacuum at the constant speed $c$.
</p>
<p>
<sup class="fn-ref">2</sup>: This has often been challenged on the grounds that the use of Pythagoras' theorem implies that the dimensions $s/c$ and $t$ are projected orthogonally (i.e., at right-angles to one another). But how else, other than orthogonally, can a set of measures be projected on the condition that they do not encroach on one another, like the vertical and horizontal dimensions of this page, or the dimensions east-west and north-south. For what possible esoteric reason would we want to project these dimensions other than at right-angles?
</p>
<p>
<sup class="fn-ref">3</sup>: This was first published in 1987, by Pope, N.V., and Osborne, A.D. in 'A New Approach to Special Relativity' <em>Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology</em>, 18, 2, 191-198.
</p>
<h2 id="ii2-instantaneous-time-delay">II.2 Instantaneous time-delay</h2>
<p>
These relativistic formulae are completely pristine and radical — just how much so may be seen in due course. First, however, we note that from formula (1) it follows that what has been traditionally conceived as a delayed time $s/c$ between one light-transacting body and another is intrinsically instantaneous (i.e., when, in this equation, the 'travelling time' $t_o$ is $s/c$, the proper time, $t$ of the transition is zero).
</p>
<p>
Many people find this extremely puzzling. It seems a complete contradiction to say that light which is proven to take time to travel in space between a transmitting source and a receiver also takes no time at all. Certainly, in any ordinary way of thinking, to say that an action which is time-delayed is also instantaneous seems like a logical contradiction. And so it is — if applied to the same single action. Logically, however, an action may have both time-delayed and instantaneous components. On a TV screen, for instance, what the viewer sees as a straightforward mechanical motion from A to B of an object in the scenario is really no such thing. We know very well that these apparently smooth and continuous motions analyse-out into time-delayed processions of instantaneous and sporadic pixel events, and that it is from the informational patterns and sequences of these events that the viewer projects all the length, breadth, depth and activity of the video scenario. Anyone who is familiar with this technology can appreciate how absurd it would be to project into any one of those pixel-events the same sort of beginning and end in the space of the scenario that actions may have in that scenario. For instance, we know that the sequences of pixel-events which the viewer projects, such as a bullet fired from a gun and travelling across the screen to strike a target, do not have the same sort of velocity, momentum and other mechanical characteristics that the viewer ascribes to the bullet.
</p>
<p>
The conception to aim at, then, in order to understand this revolutionary paradigm shift, is to switch from thinking of the ultimate informational quanta as travelling through space in the form of bullet-like light-corpuscles or as waves, to thinking of them as the irreducible observational elements out of informational patterns and sequences of which all that we perceive as space, time and motion are 'holographically' projected. The demand this makes on our powers of imagination is that of i) setting aside, clearly and consistently, the habit of assuming that nature is primarily mechanical and only kinematical in our observational representations of it (in films, videos, etc.,) and ii) adopting instead an alternative view of nature as being primarily kinematical and mechanical only in our observational representations of it. In the language of philosophy, this is to cancel the classical idea that mechanics is <em>a priori</em> and kinematics <em>a posteriori</em>, and, instead, to make kinematics <em>a priori</em> and mechanics <em>a posteriori</em> — a complete conceptual turnaround.
</p>
<p>
In this literally revolutionary way of thinking, which is on a par with Copernicus' reversing of the classical notion of the sun going round the earth to the earth going round the sun, we completely invert the classical notion of light being in space to space being in light.<sup class="fn-ref">4</sup> In all the discussions on which this present book is based, analysis reveals that the biggest sources of confusion have been due to the intrinsic intellectual difficulty of keeping these two completely incompatible ways of thinking clearly and consistently apart. To adopt the revolutionary view is to see that at the basic level of observational information which we customarily call light, there is nothing taking place between objects and observers of the sort that we normally conceive as 'interaction' involving mechanical corpuscles ('photons') travelling in a primordial vacuum, waves travelling in 'ethers', 'fields' or whatever. All that theoretical paraphernalia is removed in favour of a straightforward, non-theoretical, purely observer-based, or phenomenalist, approach to physics in which the ultimate informational elements (quanta) are as much an integral part of an object as of one's observation of it. All the usual basic dimensions of space, time, mass, etc. — including those of so-called 'light-velocity' — are then no more nor less than informational extrapolations made by the decoder (the observer) from directly observed patterns and sequences of the informational bits. This is in the same way that all the breadth, depth and duration of a video scenario are projected by the viewer out of patterns and sequences of informational elements. In the video case, these elements are the sporadically lighted screen pixels; in the real case they are the quanta into which all physical action ultimately analyses.

<strong>Figure 1</strong> In this picture we notice that there are flowers in the foreground, boats in the middle-distance and mountains in the far distance. Such a picture does not make a first call on us to see it as no more than a flat presentation in what a strong magnifying glass reveals as patterns of dots, none of which is further from the eye than the distance of the page. It is only from the informational arrangements of the dots that we see direction, brightness-differences and perspective. In fact, we see all the dimensions of ordinary reality, lacking only (in this static picture) the dimension of time. In nature we extrapolate all these qualities and dimensions of the real world from vastly more fine-grained arrangements of quantum dots or pixels. The picture would thus be even more representative of nature if it had been an interactive, omnidirectional, time-sequenced hologram.
</p>
<p>
It is in this conditional sense, and for want of a more appropriate way of describing it, that the universe of perception and experience resembles a 'hologram' rather than the implicit 'machine' of traditional 'theory'. Moreover, being devoid of any determinate mechanical linkages, the ultimate informational elements (quantum bits) of nature are entirely probabilistic in their observational appearances and sequences. All the causality that disappears on this ultimate microphysical level reappears on the ordinary macrophenomenal level, where it is replaced by purely indeterminate information-based processes. These processes are governed by statistical laws like that of Claude Shannon's information-technology rewrite of Ludwig Boltzmann's probabilistic rendering of the Second Law of Thermodynamics — or, as it is more popularly known, the Law of Entropy.<sup class="fn-ref">5</sup>
</p>
<p>
To visualise what this means, think of what we see on a television screen when the aerial is unplugged. The 'snow' we observe on the screen when this happens represents a state of maximum probability and minimum information. In this situation, what we would normally recognise as a programme appearing by pure chance would be the extreme of improbability — in fact, a miracle. The measure of improbability that we observe when the programme is running is therefore proportional to the measure of information that the programme contains. And from that informational improbability we project all the various observational properties and qualities of the programme scenario. And so it is, by analogy, with ourselves as 'viewers' of nature. The flat TV screen (or holographic plate) is replaced by a panoramic sensory presentation in which, with other observers, we are interactively immersed. It is a presentation so fine-grained that the 'pixels' cannot normally be discerned, being of quantum magnitude.<sup class="fn-ref">6</sup> Unfortunately, no language can provide perfectly fitting 'off-the-peg' words to describe concepts that are so entirely new. In breaking new conceptual ground therefore, in our selection of words we are forced to do with the nearest fit we can find, as in our choice of the word 'hologram' for the informational manifold that has been described.

<p>
When we look into space, at the planets, stars and so on, what do we see? We see objects separated from one another in different directions and dimensions. What we do not see is light 'travelling in vacuo' from these objects towards us or towards one another. Nor do we see the 'gravitational force' that is supposed to pull these objects together into orbital configurations like those of the solar system. What we actually see are bodies freely orbiting one another in systems of angular momentum. This is the observational quantity $mvr$, where $m$ is the mass of the orbiting body, $v$ is its orbital velocity and $r$ is the radius of orbit — conceived, here, as ideally circular, for simplicity.
</p>
<p>
All this is a matter of plain perception, these parameters $m$, $v$ and $r$ being projected into the physical scenario from direct observational information in the way that has already been described. In historical hindsight, then, it seems strange that Isaac Newton, viewing the motions of the heavens, conceived it as a "Law of Nature' that natural force-free motion takes place in straight lines. Newton's so-called 'First Law of Motion' is therefore profoundly unempirical, since nowhere can bodies be observed to travel in accordance with that 'Law'. Nothing in space travels in that way. Even balls on billiard tables and pucks on ice would be seen to travel in curves if the surfaces on which they travel were long enough.
</p>
<p>
Nowhere, then, is there any truly straight-line momentum $mv$ of the sort that Newton envisaged. All momentum is angular momentum $mvr$ according to the equation
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$mvr = GmM/v \qquad (4)$$</div>
<p>
where $m$ is the orbiting mass, $M$ is the balancing countermass, $v$ and $r$ are the velocity and radius, respectively of the (ideally circular) orbit, and $G$ is an empirical factor for ordinary free moving and non-spinning bodies.
</p>
<p>
What's new, here, is not this angular momentum equation, which is a standard Newtonian formulation, but that this equation has been shown to be sufficient in itself to define the parameters of free-orbiting bodies without resorting to Newton's conception of an in vacuo 'gravitational force' to account for the curvilinear nature of those orbits.<sup class="fn-ref">7</sup>
</p>
<p>
Newton's linear momentum is thus an ideal special case of an angular momentum with $r$ at theoretical infinity — a straight line and a circle of infinite radius being one and the same. When I drive my car, it stays on the road rather than travelling through the air because it does not have sufficient angular momentum to become a satellite. If it had, it would orbit the earth as naturally as the moon does and as the earth and moon do, together, around the sun. As it so happens, at whatever speed it is possible for my car to do, its natural force-free orbit with regard to the earth (if we imagine the earth's mass to be confined within the volume of, say, a football) would be somewhere way down below where we ordinarily stand.<sup class="fn-ref">8</sup> However, since the earth's surface normally prevents the car from following that natural force-free orbit, it presses upwards on the wheels of the car with a reactionary force of 9.78 newtons of force for every kilogram of the car's mass.
</p>
<p>
Why, then, did Newton's apple fall to earth in the way it did? It was because it did not have sufficient angular momentum to orbit the earth in the way the moon and other satellites do. Take away the moon's angular momentum with respect to the earth and the two bodies would automatically collapse together. This would not be by some invisible 'force of gravitational attraction', as our traditional textbooks describe it, but simply by a loss of the angular momentum which normally keeps bodies apart. By that same token, Newton's apple fell because with the angular momentum it possessed due to the earth's rotation at Woolsthorpe, its natural force-free orbit would have been 289/290ths of the distance from the ground under his feet to the earth's centre.<sup class="fn-ref">9</sup> The only force it makes sense to speak of, therefore, is not the traditional invisible 'force' acting in vacuo but the real, sensible and measurable force that is exerted by whatever it is that prevents the object from orbiting freely. In the case of Newton's apple this restraining object was the twig on which the apple hung before falling.
</p>
<p>
None of this conflicts with what, in commonsense contexts, we feel as the force preventing us from falling and which we measure on a weighing-scale or weighbridge as the 'force of gravity'. What it dispenses with is the theoretical notion of a 'gravitational field' surrounding bits of matter and pervading space. Indeed, it makes redundant all the other sorts of 'field' conceptions such as 'electric fields', 'magnetic fields' and so on, which have been constructed on the same theoretical (Newtonian) lines. For instance, converting the so-called 'charge' on an electron, in units of coulombs ($1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ C) into a mechanical spin kinetic energy in joules ($2.18 \times 10^{-18}$ J), and taking the electron's mass ($9.109 \times 10^{-31}$ kg) as no more than just a pure mass, gives an angular momentum figure for that mass, of $mvr = h/2π$ ($= 1.054 \times 10^{-34}$ kg m²/s). These are precisely the parameters which Niels Bohr deduced for the electron in the hydrogen atom on the basis of classical 'electrodynamical' theory.<sup class="fn-ref">10</sup> In any event, the measurable force required to remove the 'electron' from its lowest, or ground-level orbit around the nucleus would be in the immensely larger order of $10^{20}$ times the force required for a pair of non-spinning masses equivalent to those of the so-called 'electron' and 'proton'. For these much tighter orbits the 'gravitational constant', which is normally $6.726 \times 10^{-11}$ Nm²/kg s for macrophysical bodies in ordinary astronomical and engineering situations, is hugely increased to $1.5 \times 10^{9}$ m³/kg s for these particles with their far greater proportion of spin to orbital angular momentum. This is much more than would be possible for macrophysical bodies. Such macroscopic bodies would disintegrate long before such spin-energies could be reached, which is why, at the macrolevel, these spin-effects cannot normally be detected.
</p>
<p>
In this way, by replacing 'gravity' with angular momentum, the notorious problem of seeking the 'unified field' is solved automatically. This is by getting rid of these 'field' concepts altogether, along with all the theoretical paraphernalia that goes with them. Nor are these logical consequences to be judged trivial, or 'merely academic'. On the basis of this angular momentum synthesis it is predicted that a steel ball, of mass 2.5 kg and radius 5 cm, rotating at 2000 revolutions per second (it is just possible to spin such a ball at such a speed without disintegration) would increase or decrease in weight by one hundredth of a gram, depending on the direction of the spin with regard to that of the earth.<sup class="fn-ref">11</sup> So small is this predicted change in weight for such large amounts of spin that it is little wonder that it has never been noticed in ordinary macrophysical experience. Experiments to prove this predicted effect have not so far been carried out by our POAMS (Pope-Osborne Angular Momentum Synthesis) group for various reasons, not least due to a failure to obtain the necessary funding. However, comparing the POAMS predictions with the results of experiments that have been funded, such as those carried out by Hideo Hayasaka and his Japanese team at Tokai University,<sup class="fn-ref">12</sup> suggest that the changes in weight that they claimed for their disk of 0.175 kg, spinning at 18,000 rpm were not only much larger than we would have expected but were carried out in conditions not ideal for our prediction, which would be at the equator and therefore with an axis parallel (or anti-parallel) to that of the spinning earth. In the Hayasaka experiments, the disc was not dropped at or near the equator and was not spun in the same plane as the earth's rotation, so our theory predicts that the effects they recorded should have been even smaller than reported. This accords with the findings of Quinn and Picard of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, who judged that the Hayasaka results were spurious.<sup class="fn-ref">13</sup>
</p>
<p>
It should be mentioned, in passing, that ours is not the first attempt to dispose of Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. As is well known, in his General Theory of Relativity, Einstein pointed out that the felt 'force' we call 'gravity' disappears when we are in free fall and that it can be reproduced in free space by standing on an accelerated surface such as the inside of a centrifuge or a rocket-propelled vehicle. This he called the 'principle of equivalence' between the felt force of acceleration and gravitational force. As a consequence, General Relativity geometrises the vacuum in such a way that when standing on the earth's surface we are being accelerated upwards at a rate of 32 feet or (9.75 metres) per second per second. Unfortunately for any chance of commonsense understanding, this is difficult to square with the rather obvious fact that the earth remains the same size and is not swelling at anything like that prodigious, exponential rate.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, General Relativity does not, in and of itself, explain the existence of the other in vacuo 'forces', such as electrostatic and magnetostatic force which were conceived by Newton's successors along the same lines as his 'universal gravitational force'. This left Einstein unable to solve the problem of the unification of the various field-forces, a problem which plagued him for the rest of his life and, in the end, defeated him. This implies no disrespect for Einstein's genius. Like the tasks that the gods of the Greek pantheon sometimes set for testing men, this task of solving the problem of the 'unified field' was not a real problem but an illusory one, hence impossible to solve. It was what the philosopher Wittgenstein would have called a 'Scheinproblem' — not a problem to be solved so much as dissolved.

<h2 id="iv-the-quantum-informational-bar-code" class="chapter-title">IV. The Quantum-Informational 'Bar-Code'</h2>
<p>
In 1885, a Swiss secondary-school teacher, Johann Balmer, observed that the spectrum of light from a hydrogen gas forms what we would now call a 'bar-code-like' structure and he published a general mathematical formula for these lines. Then, in 1890, the Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg extended Balmer's work and found a general rule applicable to many other elements. More series were discovered, both in the spectrum of hydrogen and in the spectra of other elements. Stated in terms of the frequency of the light, the generalised formula may be expressed as
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$\nu = N^2 cR \left[\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2}\right] \tag{5}$$</div>
<p>
Here, $\nu$ is frequency in cycles per second, $N$ is the ordinal number of the element ($N = 1$ for basic hydrogen), $cR$ is the Rydberg frequency 'constant' of the series (for a theoretically infinite nuclear mass) and $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the fixed and running terms of the series, respectively. It is to be stressed that this formula was obtained empirically, that is, simply by the trial-and-error method of picking numbers to fit the observed spectral lines. So no theory was involved at this particular stage as to why those numbers should arrange themselves in that way. The formula expresses no more than a fact of pure observation, as a spectral 'bar code' of information identifying the character of a substance.
</p>
<h3 id="iv1-the-historical-route">IV.1 The historical route</h3>
<p>
But why do these bar-code-like patterns form in the way they do? It was not until 1913 that a theoretical explanation emerged. This was tendered by Niels Bohr, who based his explanation on a mixture of classical mechanics and electrodynamical theory, plus an <em>ad hoc</em> inclusion of the quantisation of action. This latter had been introduced in 1900 by Max Planck in his formulation of the distribution of the radiation emitted by a black body, or perfect absorber of radiant energy. The lines, Bohr supposed, were energies released by the elementary charged particles called 'electrons' orbiting like planets around the nuclear 'protons'. But, unlike the continuous motions of planets, these electrons changed orbits in discrete quantum jumps of energy $e = h\nu$, (where $\nu$ is the frequency of radiation and $h$ is Planck's constant). In Bohr's model, the jumps take place between orbit-levels denoted by the $n$ numbers in the above equation (i.e., $n = 1$ being the lowest orbit, or the one nearest the nucleus, and $n = 2, 3, 4,...$ etc. the outer orbit-levels in ascending order). The fixed term $n_1$ then designates the orbit-level from which the electron 'starts' its jump (nearest the nucleus) and the running term $n_2$ denotes the orbit-level at which it 'lands'. The atom thus loses (emits) or gains (absorbs) energy in whole and irreducible quantum amounts of Planck's constant $h$.
</p>

Modifications of this classical theory followed in quick succession. Finer structures of lines in the spectrum of hydrogen were discovered and these were explained by Arnold Sommerfeld in terms of elliptical orbits of the electrons. Then Pieter Zeeman showed that further spectral lines appeared when the sources of the spectrum were placed near a magnet. These newer orbital parameters were given newer quantum numbers, and these were rationalised by Bohr on the basis of three quantum numbers relating to the size, shape and direction of the electron's orbit. Transitions between these various orbital states sufficed to explain Sommerfeld's multiple lines, but they did not explain those extra lines that were produced by magnetism. These were eventually explained by Wolfgang Pauli as due to a hidden rotation, or spin, of the orbiting electron, and this same idea appeared in the work of the two Dutch physicists, George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit.
</p>
<p>
With these and other theoretical modifications, the full informational contents of spectra were more or less adequately explained on the basis of the hidden motions of these invisible particles. Even the periodic table of the elements which the Russian chemist, Dimitri Mendeleev, had constructed in the 1890s seemed satisfactorily explained on this same basis of invisible, theoretical mechanisms of charged particles.
</p>
<p>
In this and in other ways, theories burgeoned and things got more and more complicated. For instance, a controversy had raged, since the days of Newton and Huygens, as to whether light consists of particles or waves. The problem with particles is that it seems inconceivable that particles can create interference patterns in the way that Thomas Young had demonstrated in 1801 with a beam of light split in two and then recombined, as in his famous two-slit experiment. However, other experiments with light, such as the photoelectric effect in which electrons are ejected from the surface of a metal suggested that light consisted of particles. Reverting to Newton's corpuscular theory of light, Einstein explained this photoelectric effect as due to a kind of 'bombardment' by light-corpuscles, which he called 'photons'.
</p>
<p>
But why did these particles strike with wave-like characteristics? The answer, it seemed, to Einstein and his follower, Louis de Broglie, was provided by a forcing together of the intuitively incommensurable wave and particle theories. And so the photon was conceived to be a 'wave particle'. The fact that an entity with such opposite characteristics is inconceivable was dismissed as inconsequential, so physicists went ahead with that concept, on the grounds that it was a 'fact of nature', regardless of how intuitively unimaginable it might be that these photons had the dual nature of particles and waves. This rejection of commonsense logic and intuition was graced with the name of a principle, the principle of so-called 'complementarity'. It created the fashion, from then on, of allowing a special dispensation for physicists to think and teach in this completely nonsensical way.
</p>
<p>
As de Broglie conceived it, this 'wave-particle duality' of matter extends throughout the sub-physical world, being associated not only with Einstein's 'photons' but with the motions of particles of any sort, protons, electrons or whatever. De Broglie thought of these waves as 'pilot waves'. In atoms, they form stationary, or standing waves, in harmonic patterns around the nucleus at distances from the centre where the beginning and end of the wave-cycle are perfectly in phase. This concept of the underlying standing-wave was further developed by Erwin Schrödinger who, in January of 1926, introduced into theoretical physics a wave-equation that satisfactorily described all the quantum aspects of physical systems. Individual states, or manifestations of these physical systems were then regarded as solutions of this underlying 'wave-function' involving the superposition of harmonic states.
</p>
<p>
Later, in the summer of 1926, Max Born subjected Schrödinger's wave-function to a probability-statistical interpretation, describing it not as a continuous 'wave' but as a pure probability amplitude. In this interpretation, exactness of position and motion of elementary particles had disappeared at the quantum level. All that was left were pure wave-like 'probability functions'. The traditional notion of a 'particle' as a hard material entity was thus fast disappearing. It was to be replaced by the concept of a real physical state brought about by the 'collapsing' of a continuous, all-pervading and underlying 'wave-function' — by the mere fact of observing it. In this way, quantum physics slid further and further into the mystery we now commonly associate with it.
</p>
<p>
In 1927, Heisenberg made another discovery. This was what he called his 'principle of uncertainty'. Observing the state of a fundamental particle requires an energy-interaction with that particle, which alters its state. So the only way to determine the 'exact state' of the particle would be not to observe or detect it in any way. This means that so far as observation is concerned, the existence and state of particles on the ultimate quantum level is impossible to describe. In that case, how can these ultimate 'particles' be said to exist? Heisenberg concluded that they can't, so that particles as such do not exist at the ultimate microphysical level.
</p>
<p>
In fact, with this principle of uncertainty (or 'indeterminacy principle' as it is sometimes called) Heisenberg had plumbed the depths of all knowledge of our world, right down to its ultimate epistemological elements. In the sort of theoretical physics which sees itself as seeking to describe realities "behind the veil of perception" things were getting fraught, to say the very least. Theories began to burgeon at an exponential rate. Anyway, as already stated, to produce a chronicle of the precise details of the historical slide into the current mystique is not our concern here. What does concern us is that despite the undoubted practical efficacy of these developments for industrial, commercial and military purposes, they are all based, like 'light <em>in vacuo</em>' and <em>in vacuo</em> 'gravitational force', on concepts of things and processes that are altogether unseen and unsensed, things existing — if that is the word — in realms apart from ordinary reality. Moreover, these 'hidden mechanisms' are conceived mostly by analogy with our experiences of purely mechanical causes and effects, such as pushes and pulls, and processes like that of the conduction of sound in air or in water. But these are as inappropriate for understanding processes at the quantum level as it would be, at the level of information theory, to try to analyse a video-screen picture of a horse in terms of a knowledge of nothing but horses.
</p>
<p>
The situation is further complicated by a proliferation of meta-theories as to how this world of remote theoretical 'realities' and that of ordinary observational reality interrelate, a continuing failure to establish which goes a long way towards answering the question we started with: 'What is wrong with Modern Science?' There can be little doubt that this modern fashion of producing theories for theory's sake started with Bohr. It is reputed that a student of Bohr's, on presenting his teacher with a theoretical suggestion, told Bohr that he was worried that it might seem absurd. It is reported that Bohr replied: 'My worry is whether it may be absurd enough!' In this way, with the introduction of more and more counter-intuitive, underlying 'realities' such as those of 'wave-particles', 'complementarity', holes in a vacuum ('black holes') and other complete absurdities, contemporary physics has now very plainly advanced beyond the pale, so far as any prospect of common understanding is concerned.
</p>
<p>
Was this assault on commonsense ever really necessary? The end-aim of all those theories was to rationalise what is actually observed on the level of ordinary reality. This, as ever, remains the primary, or 'square-one' concern of any true science. But were there no explanations of these phenomena other than by way of such metaphysical excursions? Indeed there were, as may now be demonstrated.
</p>
<h3 id="iv2-the-ahistorical-route">IV.2. The ahistorical route</h3>
<p>
In the first place, we have shown that for information to be information, its ultimate elements have to be discrete and indeterminate. This is what was confirmed by the work of Heisenberg and Planck. Next, we have demonstrated that angular momentum, as a measure of visible motion, is perfectly sufficient in itself to replicate Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom without the addition of any exotic concepts of invisible 'charges' and their associated invisible 'fields'. Moreover, it has been shown that hidden 'corpuscles' and 'waves' — far less 'wave-particles' — are neither necessary nor appropriate as concepts of how light is supposed to 'travel', and that the ultimately probabilistic nature of quantum occurrences as projected by Schrödinger is no more than a logical requirement of the informational package. So what, in these alternative, purely observational terms, explains the bar-code-like structure of spectra that is represented by the numerological formula of Balmer and Rydberg? The answer to that is as follows.
</p>
<p>
The parameter that is measured in our observations of spectra is essentially that of time — or, rather, the inverse of time, which is frequency, as displayed in those experiments on light interference which reveal a resonant character in light-interactions. Now we already have an observational formula for time. This is our elementary Pythagorean facsimile of the Einsteinian formula (3), in the above section I.1, viz.:
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$t_p = t_h \sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)} \tag{3}$$</div>
<p>
This, of course, is for time as it is observed among objects on the macrophenomenal level. Let us now see what happens to this formula when its time-variables are reduced to measures of quantum magnitude.
</p>
<p>
For instance, let $t$ in this formula be some proper fraction $1/N$ of some quantum period such that for $N = 1$, $t$ represents the coefficient of the whole series. Multiples $n$ of this quantum-period $t/N$ are then integers, as also are the submultiples $N$. In mathematical terms the formula is now Diophantine, meaning that all its multiples and divisors are whole numbers — as in the mathematics of Diophantus of Alexandria, whose books on the mathematics of rational numbers were written some time between the 2nd century BC and the 3rd century AD.
</p>
<p>
So here is that same time formula expressed in basic quantum form:
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$\frac{nt}{N} = \frac{t}{N}\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)} \tag{6}$$</div>
<p>
Now we know that the standard formula for potential energy (i.e., twice the kinetic energy $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$) is $e = mv^2$. This means that we can substitute $e/m$ for $v^2$ in (6), which produces
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$\frac{nt}{N} = \frac{t}{N}\sqrt{1 - (e/mc^2)} \tag{7}$$</div>
<p>
Squaring the formula to remove the square root and dividing by the $t$ that is common to both sides of the equation then gives
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$\left(\frac{n}{N}\right)^2 = \frac{(1/N)^2}{1 - (e/mc^2)} \tag{8}$$</div>
<p>
Expressing this equation in terms of $N^2e$, we have
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$N^2e = N^2mc^2\left[1 - \frac{1}{n^2}\right] \tag{9}$$</div>
<p>
Next, dividing this formula throughout by Planck's constant $h$ expresses it in terms of frequency, $\nu$, viz.:
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$\nu = \frac{N^2mc^2}{h}\left[1 - \frac{1}{n^2}\right] \tag{10}$$</div>
<p>
In this way we arrive at a series of frequency levels of the bar-code kind that Balmer and Rydberg sought, by their trial and error method, to fit their observations of line-spectra. In fact, if we include in this series, intermediate values of $n$, taking $n_1$ and $n_2$ as the fixed and running terms, respectively, we obtain a precise facsimile of the Balmer-Rydberg formula, viz.,
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$\nu = \frac{N^2mc^2}{h}\left[\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2}\right] \tag{11}$$</div>
<p>
(compare formula (5) on page 21). The value of the coefficient $\frac{mc^2}{h}$ cannot, of course, be deduced in this way but has to be measured empirically. Its measured value is that of what spectroscopists call the Rydberg frequency-constant $cR$. With this textbook value substituted for $\frac{mc^2}{h}$ in (10), our deductive formula fits the Balmer-Rydberg formula exactly.
</p>
<p>
What, then, may we glean from this result? First, the reader may have noted the appearance in these equations of the famous $e = mc^2$ formula for mass-energy inter-conversion, as in orthodox relativity. There has been no special assumption involved in this deduction. It is purely a product of dimensional syllogistic as applied to standard definitions of the quantities involved. Equation (9) deals with measures on the ultimate microscale. On the macroscale, the $N$s in this equation lose their significance and cancel. Also the $n$s become so large as to approach infinity, which leaves us with the generalised macroscale formula
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$e = mc^2 \tag{12}$$</div>
<p>
that is familiar to students of Einsteinian relativity.
</p>
<p>
Something else we glean is that in casting around for their basic pattern of numbers to fit their observations of spectral lines, the spectroscopists, Balmer, <em>et al</em>, need really have looked no further than the Einsteinian time-formula. But of course, that formula had not appeared on the scene at the time. Balmer died in 1898, whereas Einstein's formula was not published until 1905; and Johannes Rydberg survived no more than fourteen years beyond that. However, one may speculate as to whether, but for this anachronism, Balmer and Rydberg might have latched onto this Einsteinian time-formula as providing a template for the pattern of numbers they were seeking.
</p>
<p>
Undoubtedly, however, any such discovery would have been inhibited by the altogether esoteric and 'intellectual' nature of Einstein's mathematical theory in the context of which his formula was presented, with all its obligatory metaphysic as to how light was supposed to behave in the vacuum. This would surely have obscured the formula's value as a straightforward, non-theoretical explanation of spectra deduced from nothing more than measurements made by such observers as Römer as to how time-processes behave with changing distance in pure observation.
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="v-objective-motion-and-time-dilation-in-orbiting-bodies" class="chapter-title">V. Objective motion and time-dilation in orbiting bodies</h2>
<p>
Let us remind ourselves at this stage of the objective of our observer-based approach to physics. This is, wherever possible, to redirect our attentions away from the mystical world of theory and re-focus it on the real world of direct sensory and instrumental observation. In the previous section we have seen how this can be done simply by applying certain logical rules of numbers to our original time-dilation formula. This produces the basic formula for the spectrum as it applies to observation directly, that is, by circumventing the whole history of 'electrodynamical' explanation of that phenomenon.
</p>
<p>
This same direct logical route that has been driven through the theoretical thicket in the case of electrodynamics can also be extended to 'gravity'. For instance, in observational terms we already have our formula for orbital angular momentum, viz:
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$L = mvr = \frac{GmM}{v} \tag{4}$$</div>
<p>
Now although this appears identical to the standard Newtonian formula there are, in fact, two vital differences. Not only is $G$ in the formula not a constant (see above, Ch. III) but also, like all observational velocities, the velocity $v$ is non-Newtonian — that is, it is the same relativistic $v$, limited to $c$, that appears in our time-dilation formula, namely:
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$t_p = t_h \sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)} \tag{3}$$</div>
<p>
That being the case, from (4) we have
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$v^2 = \frac{GM}{r} \tag{13}$$</div>
<p>
and substituting this equivalent expression for $v^2$ in (3) then produces
</p>
<div class="math-block">$$t_p = t_h \sqrt{1 - (GM/rc^2)} \tag{14}$$</div>
<p>
In this simple and straightforward way, we move directly from a time-dilation formula for rectilinear motion, as expressed in (3), to a time-dilation formula for orbital motion as expressed in (14). As can be seen, this is without any reference whatsoever to the usual theoretical rationale of 'gravitation', etc. The substitution of $GM/r$ for $v^2$ in (13) expresses time-dilation purely syllogistically in terms of potential energy. This supports our reasoning in Chapter III that Newton's 'gravitational' hypothesis is redundant.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the classical 'gravitational potential' of Newton, the sign of the potential energy in (14) is positive. That is to say, the zero of reference for that angular momentum potential, hence the objective zero of time-dilation, lies at the greatest distance (the largest measure of $r$) from the central mass $M$, in deep space, far from the presence of massive bodies. This is in direct contrast to the classical so-called 'gravitational' potential, whose zero lies at the centre of radius — that is, nearest to the centre of the mass $M$. Formula (14) therefore predicts that in the case of simple circular orbits there will be a time-dilation, hence a slowing of clocks in satellites as they orbit closer to the central mass. As it stands, this simple formula applies only to ideally circular orbits or for orbits of unit eccentricity (that is, a straight up-and-down motion of a body with respect to $M$). The latter is confirmed by the Pound-Rebka experiment, in which clocks placed at different levels in a lift-shaft were found to run slower as they were placed lower in the shaft.¹ In the case of circular orbits, the slowing of clocks is verified by engineers and scientists involved with satellite systems such as that of the American Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian equivalent, GLONASS. Discussions with these experts have disclosed that clocks on these satellites run quicker than clocks on the earth's surface, albeit slower than clocks further out in space, which is direct qualitative confirmation of our formula (14).
</p>
<p>
For instance, for an orbital velocity $v = 0$ in equation (3), the time-dilation is zero. That same value of zero for $v$ in equation (13) makes the orbit radius $r$ infinite, which means that the datum-zero of the scale of potential energies and time-dilations is that of a clock in deep space.² With respect to that deep-space time-standard (let's call it DST), clocks orbiting at finite distances $r$ from massive bodies lose time. For example, terrestrial clocks in solar orbit lose 426,160 nanoseconds every twenty-four hours DST, while the moon in terrestrial orbit loses just over 498 nanoseconds DST — as would any clock orbiting that distance from earth. In the case of an earth satellite, from the average data supplied by the GPS engineers the formula predicts, for a satellite in circular orbit of radius $6.372828 \times 10^6$ metres measured from the earth's centre, a loss of 7216.4 nanoseconds per 24 hrs DST. By that same formula, a clock orbiting a mass equivalent to that of earth at a distance $r$ equivalent to that of the earth's surface radius would lose 30075.66 nanoseconds per 24 hrs DST.
</p>
<p>
But of course, the clocks that register earth time (GMT) are not orbiting in that way, which would be at an earth-orbiting velocity of 7,910 metres/second. Being earth-bound, the fastest those clocks may travel is at the earth's equatorial spin-speed of 464.74 metres per second. Moreover, $G$ in our formula has its standard value only for bodies in free orbits.³ Nevertheless, taking the free-orbiting time-standard as approximate to GMT we have the result that as measured from earth the satellite gains 22859.26 nanoseconds per day, which is approximately 60% of the reported average value of 38,700 nanoseconds gained by those satellites as measured from the ground. However, we repeat that the figures predicted by the formula, while qualitatively correct, are deduced for ideally circular orbits involving no more than just two bodies in a single instance, whereas in reality, all bodies are part of the same overall angular momentum system. For instance, while the satellite is orbiting the earth, both bodies are orbiting the sun and, incipiently, the moon plus all the other satellites and planets in the solar system. As we have seen, these various relations with those other bodies incur all sorts of different time-dilations — quite large, for instance, in respect of the sun. It would surely be very strange, therefore — indeed, suspicious — if our simple formula predicted the observed GPS data with anything like a hundred percent accuracy. That these predictions are qualitatively verified is surely significant. That they should come quantitatively as near as 60% to the reported figure is even more so.
</p>
<p>
Something else emerged from these discussions. Some GPS engineers report that there are differences in the times taken for satellite signals to be received on the ground according to the direction of the orbiting satellite relative to the earth's spin with respect to the solar system. The earth spins from west to east, and anti-relativists claim to have observed changes in $c$ such that the speed of a radio signal transmitted in the direction of the earth's spin is slower than $c$ (i.e. $c - v$, where $v$ is the earth's spin speed) and faster than $c$ in the opposite direction. These differences, or anisotropies, have been claimed as evidences of 'varying $c$', hence as refutations of the very basis of relativity (Einstein's Second Axiom). However, as long ago as 1728, the astronomer James Bradley had reported his discovery of a phenomenon that has since become well-known as 'aberration'. In order to track the image of a star, a telescope has to be pointed forward of the earth's annual and daily motion of the earth relative to the heavens. As usually explained, this is similar to the way in which someone walking in vertically falling rain has to point the direction of his umbrella forward of his motion at an angle proportional to his walking speed. Thus, if $c$ were truly a velocity it would automatically obey the rule of the composition of velocities according to Figure 2, below, where $v$ is the motion of the earth with respect to the heavens and $c$ is conventionally interpreted as 'the velocity of light in space' (analogous to the falling rain). The consequence of this composition of vectors would be that the resultant, $\sqrt{c^2 + v^2}$ of the two rectangular velocity vectors, $v$ and $c$, would be greater than $c$, in contravention of the relativistic principle of the constancy of $c$ in all observational frames of reference. In Figure 3, however, we see that in relativity the hypotenuse of the vector triangle is always $c$, regardless of the angle of aberration, and that the 'resultant' ($\sqrt{c^2 - v^2}$) can never reach, far less exceed, $c$.
</p>
<p>
[Figures 2 and 3 referenced but not visible in OCR]
</p>
<p>
<strong>Figure 2 non-relativistic diagram   Figure 3 relativistic diagram</strong>
</p>
<p>
In relativity, therefore, this composition of distance-time vectors does not compromise the constancy of $c$ in the least. That is to say, in relativity the distance-time relation along the line of sight is always $c$ regardless of whatever changes in observational direction there may be. In that case, what varies is not $c$ but the dimensional components of $c$ in different observational reference-frames.
</p>
<p>
What, then, does the phenomenon of aberration tell us? It confirms Römer's discovery of the finite distance-time relation $c$ in our perceptions of distant objects. But also, in addition to Römer's discovery, it tells us what is really moving relatively to what. For instance, if the earth's orbital speed were somehow magically reduced to zero, that is, with the earth stationary in its orbit, there would be no aberration in the observational directions of the stars, no matter how they might be moving with respect to one another. So aberration tells us that it is the earth that is moving in the heavens, not the heavens that are moving with respect to the earth.
</p>
<p>
This phenomenon of aberration suggested to the early astronomers that light travels in an 'ether' by analogy with sound in air, and that the earth is moving in that air-like 'luminiferous ether'. So they reasoned that the aberration was not simply due to the relative motion between the earth and the stars. It had to be due to motion relative to an all-pervading ether, the hypothetical medium in which light was conveyed. That explanation, however, proved too facile. For instance, if light travels in an ether, then the earth's motion through that ether should be detectable, like the wind that is felt by a cyclist pedalling through still air. All attempts, however, at detecting that 'ether wind' (the most well-known of which was by A. A. Michelson and E. W. Morley, in 1887) have consistently failed, as have all other experiments attempting in other ways to verify the ether's physical existence. These consistently negative results and the subsequent revising, by Einstein, of our traditional ways of measuring distance and time are generally regarded as having disposed of any necessity for postulating an 'ether'. As a 'substance' in any sense, the 'ether' has now been relegated (in mainstream science, at least) to realms of fantasy, like 'ectoplasm' and 'phlogiston'.
</p>
<p>
However, since relativity first appeared on the scene, and despite its undoubted pragmatic value in the advancement of science, there have been, to say the least, stirrings of discontent against the theory. This has not only been on account of the loss of a medium for the conveyance of light but also for the loss of an objective standard for motion in general. For instance, Arthur S. Eddington wrote:
</p>
<p>
> All observable effects of aberration are due to relative velocity, or change of velocity. On absolute velocity it is silent; and there is reason to believe that all other experiments are silent also — a conclusion which has led to the principle of relativity.⁴
</p>
<p>
If this were true, then there would be no physical distinction between any one state of motion and any other. However, the fact of aberration does provide such a distinction. We know that if the speed of the earth in solar orbit were cancelled there would be no aberration. The same goes for the diurnal aberration due to the earth's spin. Aberration therefore provides a definite distinction between objective and relative motion. This is supported by the fact that in our formula (14) different motions entail different time-dilations.
</p>
<p>
To give a full account of all these various many-body influences is well beyond the scope of this present essay.⁵ Suffice it to say that the changes in the rates of clocks and other time-processes in the satellites used by GPS and GLONASS must, in principle, involve all these various masses in one way or another. In view of this caveat, to get within sixty percent of the actually measured effect, as we have seen, might therefore be regarded as sufficient for our present philosophical purposes.
</p>
<p>
A part of this same caveat is as follows. In our ideally isolated case of a clock in circular orbit around a single central mass $M$ the time-dilation remains regular throughout. In a real situation involving other bodies as centres, as the positions of these various centres typically change, so do the distances from the masses concerned, hence so does the time-dilation with respect to those centres. One would therefore scarcely expect to find, in a many-body situation, the same sort of regularity and directional symmetry of measures of time-dilation that characterises ideally isolated circular motion. Moreover, in angular momentum systems, motions typically add and subtract according to angular momentum orientation. Undoubtedly, these are the sorts of additions and subtractions that are reported by the GPS anti-relativists. However, as we have seen from the example of aberration, so far as relativity is concerned, none of these additions or subtractions of velocities compromises the constancy of $c$ as an upper asymptotic limit on all motion. In a debate on this subject it was suggested that all claims to have observed 'changes in $c$' are, in fact, changes in sub-$c$ velocities, as in the case of aberration, hence that these reported 'variations in $c$' are no more than special, co-linear aspects of Bradleyan 'aberration'.
</p>
<p>
Now it will scarcely have escaped the reader's notice that despite this support for Special Relativity in the fundamental matter of the constancy of $c$, there is a consequence of this angular momentum synthesis which sets it apart from standard relativity. In that standard theory, all motion is relative to the observer and all observers are equivalent as zeros of reference for relative motion regardless of whatever might be their state of motion or rest with respect to one another. This is plainly not the case with orbital time-dilation. In equation (14) the time-dilation is measured relative to the same reference-zero as that with respect to which the orbital motions are measured, namely, the centre of mass coordinate frame of the whole angular momentum system. This answers to the 'universal' frame of reference contemplated by Mach as the reference-zero for rotational motion — what astronomers call 'the reference-frame of the fixed stars'. It is the reference-frame with respect to which, as Mach pointed out, all gyroscopes orientate themselves, and, of course, all free orbits are 'gyroscopes' in their way.
</p>
<p>
This supports and is supported by the fact that if differences in measures of time-dilation among different observers are to be objective, then there has to be an objective scale of values ranging from zero to an open-ended maximum. One of the drawbacks of Einsteinian Special Relativity is that it provides no such objective scale of measures. This has made it seem to all too many of Einstein's 'Dissident' critics that what Einstein called relative time-dilation was really no more than subjective. However, as we have now seen, orbital time-dilation restores physical objectivity to time-dilation by providing an absolute zero for that scale in the theoretically motionless centre-of-balance of all the various masses and motions in the whole angular momentum system, the frame that has been called the angular momentum 'alpha frame'.⁶ Whether the extent of this alpha frame is finite or infinite is a moot point, not to be prejudged here but to be discussed in contexts of astronomy and cosmology.⁷

<h3 id="v1-the-notorious-twins-paradox">V.1 The notorious 'twins paradox'</h3>
<p>
One of the most disconcerting and time-consuming — not to say time-wasting — issues concerning Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity has always been, from its very start, a continued squabble over what many of its critics have named "The Clock Paradox" — or 'Twins Paradox' as it is sometimes called. This dispute is fuelled by what is regarded as the lack of an objective zero for the above-mentioned scale of time-dilations. This makes it difficult to distinguish, objectively, which of any two relatively moving time-systems (of a pair of twins, say), is truly time-dilated and which, conversely, is truly time-contracted, relatively to which. The 'paradox', as it seems to many people, is that without being able to specify a true zero of motion, we seem to have the consequence that as a result of a relative motion between them each twin ends up both older and younger than the other, which, of course, is absurd.
</p>
<p>
In standard Special Relativity there is no such paradox. As Einstein explained to the author of this book in 1954 (see Figure 4, overleaf):

Dear Sir:
</p>
<p>
Your question concerns the wellknown "clockparadoxon" and is very well formulated. The answer is:
</p>
<p>
Two observers B₁ and B₂, each at rest in an inertial system, can only encounter each other once.
</p>
<p>
To make possible a second encounter one of the two observers, f.i. B₂, has to reverse his speed. He is at rest, first, in an inertial system S₁ and later in a (third) inertial system S₂" which has another time as S₁. This reversal distinguishes observer B₂ in comparison to observer B₁ who is constantly at rest relative to the same coordinate system S₁. This is the cause of the dissymmetry of the result with respect to the two observers B₁ and B₂.

<strong>Figure 4 Einstein's explanation of the so-called 'clock paradox'⁸</strong>
</p>
<p>
As can be seen, this explanation is given by Einstein in terms of classical straight-line 'inertial' motion. However, in section III we saw that there is no such thing as straight-line free motion, that all truly free motion is naturally orbital, with no <em>in vacuo</em> forces being responsible for those curved trajectories. The nearest we get to that rectilinear, or 'inertial' free motion is a circular orbit of near-infinite angular momentum, hence near-infinite radius. In other words, at great distances from one another, bodies behave much as Galileo and Newton imagined, in what they thought of as a self-sufficient Euclidean space, which physicists (e.g., Einstein) still call 'inertial'.
</p>
<p>
In that approximately classical 'inertial space', for a pair of non-spinning bodies of equal mass to remain separate from each other they would have to share an angular momentum $mvr = Gm_1m_2/v$, where $v$ is the speed in the (assumed circular) orbit, with regard to the centre of balance or barycentre of the two masses. With unit measures of $m_1$ and $m_2$ (that is, one kilogram each), and $r = 1$ metre, the orbital speed would be $v = \sqrt{Gm_1m_2/r}$, which is virtually stationary. This confirms that in this remote region of space, where there are no large masses, the situation is approximately that of Newtonian 'inertial space', in which the laws of motion that apply are (approximately) the ordinary Newtonian laws. It is this situation that is implied by the motions that Einstein describes in his letter.
</p>
<p>
For this artificial scenario involving near-rectilinear motions of small masses, Einstein's solution works perfectly, as one might well expect.⁹ A more realistic solution, however, is provided by time-dilation in orbiting bodies, where it is plain that the objective reference-zero for the scale of time-dilations is the angular momentum alpha frame, described in the previous section. As already seen, in equation (14), $GM/r$ is the potential energy of an orbiting body with respect to the zero of deep space, so that the nearer to the centre of the orbit radius a body descends, the greater becomes its potential energy, hence the greater its time-dilation according to that formula, as confirmed in the GPS and Pound-Rebka situations.
</p>
<p>
This angular momentum alpha frame, which serves as the objective zero for all free motions and consequent time-dilations answers, as we have said, to the Machian frame of the 'fixed stars'. It is a universally preferred frame of reference, the conspicuous lack of which, in standard relativity, chronically sustains the charge of 'subjectivity'. This universally preferred frame is well described as 'the firmament' insofar as that word derives from the Latin word for the heavens, <em>firmamentum</em>, meaning 'firm', or 'unmoving'.

<h2 id="vi-space-in-light-not-light-in-space" class="chapter-title">VI. Space in Light, not Light in Space</h2>
<p>
We have seen, in Chapter III, that the observational package of dimensions that is angular momentum is sufficient in itself to explain the motions of masses, not only on the ordinary macrophenomenal level but also on the microphenomenal level, where it analyses out to ultimate irreducibles such as our purely formal facsimile of the Bohr atom. Also we have seen (Chapter IV) that the interactions between these 'atoms' analyse out into observational bar-code-like informational packets identical to those described by Balmer and Rydberg. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that these quantum transactions in what is customarily called 'light' do not involve any intrinsic time or distance, but that time and distance — and causality — are macrophysical measures extrapolated out of statistical numbers of these direct quantum interrelations between the perceived object and the eye or some other optical instrument.
</p>
<p>
This 'top-down', or holistic, approach to atomic physics contrasts completely with the traditional, 'bottom-up' or reductionist (Democritan) approach. The essential difference is that in the Democritan approach, atoms, with their internal constitutions and mechanisms of interaction, are conceived as absolutely objective things-in-themselves, underlying and inaccessible to direct observation, as automatons possessed of their own internal powers of causality, whereas in the holistic approach these things have no existence other than as terminals of observational analysis. No difference between any two such approaches, therefore, could be greater. In this newer approach there are things known on the macrophenomenal level which are in no way reducible to atomic mechanisms. Examples are all that goes with human consciousness and society, as well as life itself. In this sense, the holistic approach is far more realistic than the traditional approach to physics which alienates the subject from so many life sciences such as biology, sociology, zoology, psychology and, not least, from ordinary commonsense.
</p>
<p>
In our holistic, information-based, account of scientific experience, we retain all that is normally regarded as real, without having to concoct any underlying 'realities' that are purely theoretical, not to say metaphysical, in order to explain them. In other words, the world of ordinary observation is sufficient in itself as an explanation of what goes on, without need of metaphysical elaboration.
</p>
<p>
We need to remember, then, that when we talk about 'physical reality', in the context of our holistic approach, we are not referring to the usual hidden causal mechanisms of conventional Democritan physics. Physical reality is what we start with on the ordinary macrophenomenal level, and 'atoms' are what we end up with, in an analytical 'drilling-down' process which starts at the surface of our knowledge of the world and finishes at whatever turns out to be the absolute rock-bottom of that knowledge — that is, with the ultimate informational bits, the quanta, beyond which it makes no sense to delve.
</p>
<p>
However, unlike the featureless 'bits' of contemporary computer-technology, the ultimate 'bits' of quantum-phenomenology turn out to be whole packets of inseparable measures of mass, length and time. These terminal irreducibles of the 'drilling-down' operation are i) Planck's quantum $h$, which is the product of energy and time, and ii) the related quantum of angular momentum, $h/2\pi$, which is the product of the measures mass, radius and velocity. These latter are what we might call quantum accumulators — more conventionally called 'atoms'. They are the ultimate irreducibles of quantum magnitude $m_1v_1r_1 + M_2v_2r_2 = h/2\pi$, where $m$ and $M$ are the masses equivalent to the so-called 'electron' and 'proton', respectively. These quantum accumulators are basically as described in Chapter III. The quanta $h$ are then the quanta of proper-time-instantaneous interactions between these accumulators ('atoms') whose energies of interaction form the spectral, bar-code-like series described in section 2 of chapter IV. These quanta are the ultimate informational bits of light-information that conventional theoretical physics calls (or, rather, miscalls) 'photons'.
</p>
<p>
However, in the same way that there are really no such particles as 'photons', neither are there such things as 'atoms' — not in the immediate observational sense of <em>real</em> that we have described. In other words, these 'atoms' have no independent existence or permanence as 'things-in-themselves'. Their only existence is as events in relation to one another within the context of the macrophenomenal whole which we ordinarily experience as nature. And, of course, things which have no permanence cannot have any continuity of location or change in location. This impossibility of determining the exact position and momentum of atomic particles is our phenomenological equivalent of Heisenberg's 'uncertainty relation'. Such position and momentum as these ultimate irreducibles have, therefore, they possess, not in themselves, but only in holistic contexts of macrophysical observation. Obviously, nobody ever went into the sub-world that Democritus imagined to stand alongside an atom and describe its behaviour. In all cases of measuring atoms and their mechanisms, the standpoint of the observer is always in this world, not that 'other world' of theoretical imagining.
</p>
<p>
In our holistic 'top-down' approach to physics, therefore, 'smashing atoms' as a means of discovering the rules governing their behaviour is no more appropriate than smashing chessmen to discover the rules of chess. Nobody ever 'smashes atoms', anyway, not even in those institutions such as CERN, Brookhaven, or Fermilab, whose work is often described as studying 'particle-collisions', 'atom-smashing' and the like. So far as we are concerned, that is an extravagant and entirely misleading misuse of language.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, what our holistic approach examines, at this ultimate micro-phenomenal level, are not mechanical 'collisions' but resonances of the kind that the Balmer-Rydberg formula describes. And these resonances are not those of 'waves' travelling in an 'ether' or in any other kind of medium. They are the resonances of interactions which are direct, immediate and instantaneous, according our relativistic time formula (see Chapter II section 2).
</p>
<p>
So what is it that makes us think that this ultimate observational information we call light 'travels <em>in vacuo</em>'? In our information-based approach, light is not a 'carrier' of information, it <em>is</em> the information itself. Another way of saying this is that, as already stated in Chapter II, far from thinking of light being 'in space', we think of space — and all it contains — as being <em>in</em> the light.¹⁰ The difference this makes may be seen as follows.
</p>
<h3 id="vi1-the-epr-controversy">VI.1 The 'EPR' Controversy</h3>
<p>
In the so-called 'Copenhagen' interpretation of quantum physics, after Bohr, a particle and its observation form a single angular momentum system. This is based on the principle of the conservation of angular momentum, according to which angular momentum has to be conserved instantly between particles regardless of distance, a condition called 'non-locality'. In May, 1935 a paper appeared in <em>Physical Review</em> (Vol. 47, 777-780) written by Einstein in collaboration with Boris Podolski and Nathan Rosen, challenging Bohr and his followers. This was on the grounds of Einstein's classical assumption of 'locality', or separateness, according to which it is nonsense to expect that measuring the state of a particle at one place is tantamount to determining, immediately, the state of another particle somewhere else, which may be perhaps billions of kilometres distant. Such an instantaneous 'action-at-a-distance' was forbidden by his theory of relativity, according to which (as Einstein and his colleagues conceived it) nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. So something, they judged, had to be wrong, or at least 'incomplete', with Bohr's theory of inseparability, or non-locality.
</p>
<p>
This clash between Bohr and Einstein, which continued unresolved for thirty years became known as the notorious 'EPR' (Einstein, Podolski, Rosen) controversy. Then, in 1964, John Bell, of CERN (the European Centre for Research in Geneva), suggested a way of deciding, on experimental grounds, whether or not Bohr's instantaneous action-at-a-distance, or 'non-locality', existed. These experiments were carried out in 1978, at Berkeley, USA, by John Clauser and his team, also in 1982 in Paris, by Alain Aspect and his group. The results of these experiments were regarded as having proved Bohr's contention that despite Einstein's objections, instantaneous action-at-a-distance really is an underlying fact of nature.
</p>
<p>
However, despite the heady enthusiasm this created at the time, controversy continues to rage, even now, over what is still known as the 'EPR paradox'. The 'paradox' is that both Bohr's and Einstein's positions seem to be confirmed experimentally. But it seems a complete contradiction that, on the one hand, relativistic physics proves that nothing can travel faster than light, whereas on the other hand, quantum physics proves that distant interactions can be instantaneous. Not even Bohr's complementarity principle has been able to cope with that.
</p>
<p>
However, what sustains this 'paradox' is nothing more than the persistence of Einstein's classical interpretation of $c$ as 'the speed of light'. In the Bondian interpretation of $c$ as a plain constant, or distance-time conversion factor, the 'paradox' simply disappears. As we have seen, the intrinsic, or 'proper' time of a quantum light-transition is then instantaneous, and the distance over which it is said to 'interact' reduces to zero. This means, in effect, that what Einstein conceived as the 'separation' between the beginning and end of a quantum light-interaction vanishes and its 'two ends' collapse into a non-separation, a single event common to both the object and the observer in the way that quantum physics requires. What we customarily think of as the 'finite speed of light' is then no more than just another observational projection of the holographic scenario to complement the whole extrapolated dimensional package, mass, length and time. In other words, while everything in this scenario analyses-out to sequences of informational 'blips', each one of which is a quantum $h$, the measure of that sequence is the time $t$, in formula (1), Chapter II section 1 page 9. As can be seen in that formula, when the intrinsic transition-time of the quantum is zero, the observer-time $t_h$ is the delayed time $s/c$.
</p>
<p>
There is, then, in our information-based way of thinking no 'EPR paradox'. It turns out to be just another <em>scheinproblem</em>. The proper-time of a quantum transition is instantaneous and distanceless, and in the distances that the observer extrapolates out of patterns and sequences of these fundamental events, the ratio of that instantaneous distance-measure to the time-measure of the sequence is $c$. There is no contradiction in this any more than there is in a movie, where the movie scenario consists of time-sequences of still pictures, or 'stills'. In each of those stills the objects are presented to the viewer simultaneously, with no question of anything 'travelling' — or, indeed, of anything happening at all — between one still and the next. And so it is with the quantum stills in what we think of as atomic interaction.
</p>
<p>
But, it may be asked, why does $c$ have such a strange and unique value (i.e., $c = 299,792.458$ kilometres to the second)? The reason is simply the circumstantial choice of units for distance and time in our mensurational history. In hindsight, we might have chosen units of distance-measure and time-measure such that $c$ is unity. This would have removed $c$ from all subsequent physics equations and dispensed with all conceptual problems associated with it.
</p>
<h3 id="vi2-angular-momentum-and-inertia">VI.2 Angular momentum and inertia</h3>
<p>
When we are riding in a bus and the driver suddenly applies his brakes, what throws us forward? Customarily, we think of it as the force of momentum, or inertia. But is this a force? No, there is no force throwing us forward. The force is what's holding us back. It is the force exerted by the seat belt, the hanging-strap, the friction of the seat or whatever, which is preventing our bodies from moving smoothly forwards in the way they did before the driver braked.
</p>
<p>
It is the same if we are orbiting freely inside a space vehicle. When the pilot operates the rocket-motor we are thrown towards the frame of the ship in whichever direction is opposite to that of the motor's thrust, where some surface or other stops our bodies from orbiting freely, with respect to the earth, the sun, the stars, etc., in the way they did before the thrust was applied.
</p>
<p>
It is only in such situations that we can, so to speak, 'feel' the presence of those distant bodies. As the physics philosopher, Ernst Mach, is reported to have said, "When the subway train jerks it is the fixed stars that throw you down".¹¹ This angular momentum connection with distant bodies is instantaneous in the sense that nothing has to travel at any kind of speed between one's body and those distant bodies to connect the events of the driver applying his brakes and one's body being thrown forward. The two events are absolutely simultaneous.
</p>
<p>
The same applies to those distant bodies in relation to one another. As in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, the law of conservation of angular momentum demands that any jolt, or change in the angular momentum that any one of these bodies receives instantly affects its balance with all the others to some extent or other in the angular momentum nexus of which their correlated orbital motions are an inseparable part. These angular momentum connections may be described as 'felt' connections, insofar as those changes in them which we call 'inertia' may be accompanied by the sort of visceral sensations which sometimes cause travel sickness. But how do these felt connections compare with their seen connections?
</p>
<p>
Suppose we see the jolt that in the one body affects all the others in that instantaneous way. When a piece of the Shoemaker-Levy comet struck Jupiter in July 1994, was that event seen at the same instant that our seismographs might have recorded it?¹² Our answer has to be, yes, because as we have seen, vision is proper-time-instantaneous. Anything faster than that, according to our relativistic time-equation (3) in Chapter II, section 1, would get there before it started. In other words, it would travel backwards in time with the effect preceding the cause, which is surely a reduction to absurdity of that assumption. This means that experimentalist claims to have discovered 'faster-than-light', or so-called 'superluminal' influences are at least, suspect. Unless our whole thesis is wrong, these claims, if not actually false, have to be misinterpretations of factual evidence.
</p>
<p>
We may take it, then, that these immediately felt connections which our bodies have with bodies in general and which Mach identified as 'inertia', are proper-time-instantaneous in the same manner as the seen connections. In other words, the felt and the seen are all part of the same basic quantum informational manifold as that out of which, as decoders of that information, we extrapolate the world around us. This means that inertia is basically quantised in the same way as light — that is, into 'kinematic' time-sequences of instantaneous quantum-connections or 'stills', which, in observational space and time, evince a ripple-like, sequential character, as of a 'wave' travelling from the source to the sink at a distance-time rate $c$. So in the same way that we see distant bodies instantly we also feel their presence instantly, as in the phenomenon of 'inertia'. For instance, while Römer was viewing an eclipse of Jupiter's satellite in 1676, he might also have seen the planet hit by a meteorite in the way that was observed in 1994. In those observations, of the eclipse or the meteor-strike there could have been no measurable time-delay between the seen and the felt observations over the distance. The only measure of the time-delay $s/c$, in both cases, would have been that of the kinematic time-sequences of those simultaneously felt and seen interconnections. This is explained as follows.
</p>
<p>
For instance, consider our responses to those distant events. Suppose, for instance, that we indicate our receipt of a signal from some distant source by reflecting it back, by a mirror, say, or transmitting a live TV picture of us being affected by that signal. An observer at that distant source will see and (if the effect is large enough) feel that response-signal of ours instantly. But if we perceive him instantly and he perceives us instantly, then what constitutes the experimentally measured time-delay incurred in any to-and-fro signalling between him and us? The answer is that our perceiving him and his perceiving us are not just one single event, but two. This point warrants some emphasis in view of the confusion it has generated in discussions, due to an underlying assumption that a transmitted signal and the reflected signal have to be one and the same instantaneous event. On its most basic level, in order for us to see that other observer, a quantum of energy has to be transferred instantly from an atom in his body to an atom in our eye or some other observing instrument. Let's suppose that our recipient instrument is an atom in a mirror. Obviously, a single atom cannot both gain and lose a quantum in a single instance. So our receipt of a quantum and the reflecting back of a quantum, no matter how quick the 'turnaround' at the mirror, have to be two events in succession, one in which the mirror-atom gains a quantum and another in which it loses, or emits (reflects) one. Again, in neither of those events is there any transitional time-delay. The time-delay, as already stated, is in the sequences of those signals, not in the signals themselves.
</p>
<p>
But although there is sequence, there is no distance involved in those quantum exchanges as such. Since their intrinsic transition-time ('proper-time') $t_p$ is zero, their intrinsic transition-distance is also zero (i.e., $s = ct_p = 0$). As we have seen, it is only in macrophenomenal contexts that measures of distance signify. In those contexts, from the measurements made by Römer which produce our basic formula (1) (see page 9) we know that when the intrinsic transition-time of a signal is zero, the relative or observational time of that transition is the delayed time $t_h = s/c$. This means that over the observational distance $s$ between the corresponding observers, the overall observational $t_h$ time of the two-way signal in each observer-frame is $2s/c$, where $c$ is as measured by Römer, <em>et al</em>.
</p>
<p>
According to our reasoning, then, the visual connection with those distant bodies and the Machian felt connection are on the same footing, which is that they are both proper-time-instantaneous and both relativistically time-delayed, with there being no logical contradiction involved in that statement. What makes this so difficult to comprehend, as has ever been the case with those seeking to understand relativity, is our incipient, classically conditioned and completely unsupported habit of thinking that behind all these relative events there is some 'absolute' way of describing them, as though they may be viewed from the standpoint of some omnipresent and all-seeing deity in a time which is the same everywhere. It is only in that presumptuous 'God's-eye-view' of space and time that relativity is made to seem paradoxical. If we firmly jettison that presumption of observational ubiquity and stick to the relativistic rule that all physical descriptions of the world are finite and observer-centred and that no observer can ever be in more than one place in any single instance, all suggestion of paradox disappears. We perceive these events each in our own time and each distant observer perceives them in his own time. Only some presumed ubiquitous deity or demon may be supposed to perceive all those different perceptions together and we can have no clue as to how things might appear from such an entirely metaphysical point of view.
</p>
<p>
Even so, much of what is generally regarded as the sheer intellectual difficulty of understanding relativity is really no more than the persistence of a basic and subliminal, superstitious dread of losing the sense of absolute security that is afforded by that completely incoherent 'God's-eye-view' notion. We like to think that behind all our finite dealings with the world there is an absolutely permanent reality that is 'in God's hands' and which we can do nothing about. It scares us to think that much of the carving-out of the course of history that relativity entails may be in our hands. To be given that power of intervention places upon us, we may feel, far too great a burden of responsibility.
</p>
<p>
However, we shall return to that question later. For now let us reflect that since there can be no monolithic overall universe of observational perspectives, then neither can there be any monolithically conserved angular momentum (inertial) connection between orbiting bodies, nor any monolithic conservation of the energy that is transferred in light-interaction between them. Indeed, if there were, then the result would be an Eleatic stasis or 'gridlock'.¹³ The law of conservation, therefore, as applied to both energy and angular momentum, cannot be maintained in any imaginary single and overall monolithic way, instant by cosmic instant. It has to be conserved in vast numbers of sporadic, basically 'chain-link' sequences of quantum connections in which all transactions of energy and angular momentum are discrete and individual (i.e. quantised) but never broken. This is something like the continuity of a team's possession of the baton passed by the runners throughout a relay-race.
</p>
<p>
Logically, then, there is no 'EPR' paradox associated with the instantaneously 'felt' connections any more than there is with the seen. Quantum instantaneity and relativistic time-delay are not contradictory but complementary — not in the sense of Bohr's <em>ad hoc</em> 'complementarity principle' but really complementary, as in our example of cinematography (also, of course, in our relativistic formulae).
</p>

¹ In 1960, Robert V. Pound and Glen A. Rebka carried out an experiment employing Mössbauer (i.e., gamma) emitters, the recoils of whose nucleons were restrained within crystal lattices. In using these recoil-less nuclear emitters and absorbers, the experimenters discovered that in order to resonate with an emitter of standard gamma radiation higher up in the lift-shaft of a tall building, an observing instrument (gamma absorber) placed lower down in the shaft had to be tuned to absorb blue-shifted periods. That is to say, it had to be run more quickly than the emitter above. On the other hand, in order to resonate with an emitter lower down, the observing instrument had to be tuned to receive red-shifted periods. That is, it had to be run more slowly than normal. From the point of view of the observing instrument, therefore, those nuclear clocks that were above it manifested periods shorter than the standard period (their frequency was blued, or quickened) and those below manifested periods that were longer (their frequency was reddened, or slowed).
</p>
<p>
In other words, if the Pound-Rebka results are correct, then the higher in a tower a nuclear clock is raised the faster it ticks, and the lower it descends the slower it ticks — the standard tick being, in this case, a single cycle of the gamma quantum. This is taken as confirmation of Einstein's prediction, in his General Relativity, that clocks in a gravitational field are slowed in proportion to the strength of the field. As our reader will no doubt have realised, our formula (14) predicts this same phenomenon without any of the conventional presuppositions of 'gravitational fields' or their effects on 'photons' in the context of General Relativity.

² Someone asks: if the zero of potential energy is in deep space, then why do bodies which lose potential energy fall to earth? Why don't they just float off into space? The answer is that as an orbiting body loses energy it loses angular momentum, which is energy × time (i.e., action). A loss of angular momentum reduces the distance $r$ of the orbiting body from the central mass $M$. In this way, with loss of energy and therefore loss of angular momentum, the body falls to earth.

⁶ A word of caution needs to be introduced here regarding use of the word 'absolute'. To say that something is absolute means that it exists independently of anything but itself, as indeed our alpha frame does if it is truly all-encompassing. To say, however, that a motion is absolute means that a body may have that motion in itself independently of any relation with other bodies, which would be false. To say the opposite of this, that the body has objective motion relative to other bodies in an absolute framework of other motions, as Mach claimed, is correct.

¹³ The pre-atomistic philosophers of Elea, led by Parmenides, reasoned that since a state of nothing cannot be, then there can be no such thing as a void. Space is therefore, they concluded, an illusion and that, at root, there is no void, so that everything is one, eternal and immutable. Since this implied that there can be no such thing as motion (for into what space could an object move?), the atomists, after Democritus, regarded this consequence as a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of the Eleatic oneness. Space, they said, cannot be an illusion because for motion and fluidity to be possible — which it evidently is — the void has to be real. These atomists therefore, as it is said, 'shattered the Eleatic One into fragments, which they called 'atoms' and reified the 'nothing' as a space in which they could move.

<p>
Something which it is all too easy for a theoretical physicist or cosmologist to do is to draw, on a blackboard, say, a large circle or square to represent 'the universe'. In this enclosed domain, the audience, like the theoretician, can fancy that they are some kind of 'God' who can see everything all over, everywhere within those chalk boundaries.
</p>
<p>
The theoretician may then produce mathematical equations, working inwards from that 'all-encompassing' effigy towards some sort of logical and/or mathematical 'explanation' of what he presents as a true scientific representation of 'the universe'. But how can that possibly represent 'the universe'? To be truly a universe, that chalk boundary would have to include the man with the chalk, the audience, the room... in fact everything there is. But, of course, it doesn't. So in no way can that chalked enclosure represent — or even resemble — 'the universe'. Nevertheless, theoreticians, in their minds, if not on blackboards, draw some sort of boundary which, they fancy, encompasses everything and then work inwards from there as though solving an algorithm.*
</p>
<h3 id="vii1-the-big-bang">VII.1 The 'Big Bang'</h3>
<p>
Take, for example, the theory of the so-called 'Big Bang', or 'Expanding Universe', as it is sometimes called. Who observes this expansion? Certainly no human being does. The reasoning on which this idea was based is that the distant galaxies are seen to be moving away from us at speeds which are greater in proportion to their distance, in a relation called the Hubble constant. What Hubble actually measured, however, was never the recessional motion of the galaxies. What he measured were shifts preponderating towards the red in the spectra of those galaxies in accordance with their observed distance. To assume that this is the same as 'seeing those galaxies receding' is entirely speculative. But since it arbitrarily excludes other logically possible explanations of the Hubble redshift, it is a dogma by definition. Moreover, this dogma is compounded by the preferential selection of 'evidences' in its favour which are perfectly explicable on other grounds.
</p>
<p>
The plain fact is that the number of other logical possibilities that are still available are far from exhausted. 'Tired light', explanations due to loss of energy over the distance simply don't work, insofar as this would involve dispersion — i.e., spreading and confusing of the bands, which is not typical in this case. However, the Hubble redshifts can be perfectly described as time-dilations due, not to motions of uniform recession but to increasing speeds of a random nature. For instance, it has been proposed that, since our formulae have shown that the greatest velocities and time-dilations of bodies are nearest the greatest masses; and since the greatest masses in an infinitely extended universe are always, cumulatively, at the farthest distance from the observer, the greatest time-dilations of bodies generally should be those measured on the scale of distance that we associate with the galaxies.† In any event, there can be no explanation of the red shift that is more absurd than that offered for the expansion view, which is that the whole universe of matter, space, time and everything that there is, exploded into being from something the size of a pea some fifteen billion years ago, to which there is no logical, philosophical or commonsense meaning.

<h3 id="vii2-black-holes">VII.2 'Black holes'</h3>
<p>
Many theoreticians seem to enjoy confounding us by creating 'Gee-Whiz' absurdities for their own sake, from observational information that, with a little bit of commonsense application can be interpreted in much simpler ways. For instance, a theory that ordinary folks regard as nonsense is that of 'black holes'. The rationale for believing in black holes is that stars and even galaxies are observed to rotate very rapidly around centres of apparently no substance, hence regarded as invisible centres of immense mass. However, there is no reason to assume that centres of balance for bodies in balanced angular momentum situations are mass-objects. If the planets in our solar system were much larger than they are in comparison with our sun, the centre of rotation of the sun and planets might well lie outside the sun's surface, somewhere in the void between the sun and all its planets. Observed from a great distance, it might seem that these bodies are rotating around an invisible centre of balance which, in itself, emits no radiation. To call this a 'black hole' may be picturesque but, unfortunately, lends itself to the sort of journalistic distortion that perverts the true course of science.
</p>
<p>
The same applies to stars and galaxies. Their centres of balance are not necessarily material objects capable of being visible as such. To call these centres 'black holes' is therefore whimsical. Well, alright, so speculating in that way, in what has been called the hypothetico-deductive method has, in the past, definitely proved useful to science and, especially, technology. Unfortunately, as science has advanced, these speculative and over-elaborated theories have proliferated to an extent that, in the place of nature, students are now confronted by an educational curriculum in which it is de rigueur for them, in order to graduate, to satisfy their examiners that they have studied as many as possible of these revered theoretical precedents. All their studies therefore have to be 'focussed' towards conventional scholarship before they are allowed the privilege of examining nature for themselves. Unfortunately, by then, any innocent curiosity they might have had for studying nature and thinking about it — to say nothing of the opportunities for raising deep and embarrassing questions about it — may well have been all but completely suppressed by a concern for seeking scholarly excellence according to the arbitrary standards of a competition-orientated Educational system. (This calls to mind what the poet Wordsworth wrote: 'Shades of the prison house close upon the growing boy'.)
</p>
<p>
However, to study the ideas of famous people is not necessarily the same thing as studying the world of nature. So, despite its early successes, especially in areas of technology, the emphasis in modern Physical Science has become so over-weighted in favour of theory that the subject has now virtually turned turtle, leaving not only its student passengers but also its crew of teachers floundering. Fewer and fewer students are attracted to the subject, and departments of Physics are being shut down all over, so that universities are directed towards funding 'more sensible' and 'cost-effective' subjects, such as Business studies, Management and Computer Science. In more and more universities, even Media Studies and Sports Science have ousted Theoretical Physics.
</p>
<p>
Why has all this happened? It seems doubtful whether it would have happened if our modern physics had been able to retain something like the hold on commonsense interest that the subject once had, in the heady days just after its breakaway from dogmatic religion. Nowadays, physics has nothing like that same commonsense appeal. Indeed, that original situation has now been reversed, with 'modern physics' having become as divorced from commonsense as ever had been the teachings of the Church cosmologists. Our analysis of this modern loss of commonsense appeal is that it is due to the intellectual remoteness of the world of modern physics, with its purely theoretical 'fields' and 'field-forces' and other goings-on in sub-worlds of mathematical reasoning; worlds which are as obscure to the ordinary man, nowadays, as ever were the goings-on in heaven and the systems of Ptolemaic cosmology prior to Copernicus.
</p>
<h3 id="vii3-some-very-big-mistakes-in-physics">VII.3 Some very big mistakes in physics</h3>
<p>
Our analysis has also revealed that this whole plethora of intricate theories-within-theories, like the 'wheels within wheels' of the Ptolemaic system is a creation, not of nature but of man. That is to say, it exists only because two of our most revered scientists, Newton and Einstein, each with his own overplus of theoretical vigour and imagination, made some very big mistakes. Newton's was to declare, in the face of all observations to the contrary, that natural force-free motion takes place in straight lines; and the plain fact that they don't was then explained as due to an invisible, universal in vacuo field-force called 'gravity'. But why did Newton give us those two laws when only one would do? And why did so many generations of students not notice that angular momentum is sufficient in itself to explain the orbital nature of free-moving bodies without having to create these metaphysical 'force-fields'? The answer is that they were not encouraged to think for themselves but to keep their eyes reverently glued to the writings of these lionised intellectuals.
</p>
<p>
So, what was Einstein's comparable Big Mistake? It was to follow in the theoretical tracks of Newton, whose theory of a 'gravitational field' had been added to by similar theories of electrostatic and magnetostatic 'fields'. This made him think of Römer's discovery of the constant relation $c$ between units of metres and seconds as the speed of propagation in the classical vacuum of a sequence of electric and magnetic 'fields'. The fact that his Theory of Relativity, which was based on that assumption, removed any question of the existence of any sort of medium for that conveyance then created the theoretical convolutions and conundrums that have become the mainstay of modern Theoretical Physics. This, in order to save face with itself and with a reverential public, has boldly demanded a complete and authoritative abandonment of commonsense logic.
</p>
<p>
The Emperor was plainly naked, but who was going to admit it?
</p>
<p>
So, what does nature look like when we admit the illusoriness of all this metaphysical overlay? This takes us right back to where modern science 'went pear-shaped'. It reveals the plain fact that the relativity of time — which is the basis of relativity generally — can be derived from plain observation, without dressing it up with Newton's metaphysic of invisible 'fields' and without its associated interpretation of Römer's constant $c$ as the invisible 'velocity of light in a vacuum'. Seeing quantum physics bared of this same sort of 'field' metaphysic, together with its associated notion of invisibly travelling 'waves' leaves us, in a similar way, with the plain observational fact of the ultimate discreteness of the informational elements from which we obtain our knowledge of the world.
</p>
<p>
Newton once said: 'If I have seen further, it is from standing on the shoulders of the Giants.' That may well have been the case, at that time. However, now that our views are obscured on all sides by so many of these intellectual giants, all standing on one another's shoulders, perhaps our best recourse, in glimpsing nature as it really is would be to escape, on our knees, between those gigantic legs. This, in effect is what we have tried to do in the extramural talks and seminars which have led to the production of this book.
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="viii-form-and-substance" class="chapter-title">VIII. Form and Substance</h2>
<p>
The very radical difference between our 'holographic', information-based approach to physics and similar theories is that it involves no assumption of an underlying 'wave-function' or any other kind of continuous connection between the ultimate informational elements (quanta). Indeed, it assumes no 'universe' of the sort classically conceived as having a single space of its own and a single time of its own in which that universe either expands or collapses. What it proposes, instead, is a manifold — a pluriverse or polyverse — of interacting and often autonomous agents, (encoders and decoders of quantum information), some of which are entirely rudimentary and some of which, like ourselves and other organisms, are not so rudimentary.
</p>
<p>
In other words, in our ahistorical way of thinking, there is no underlying continuum but only, on the ultimate microphenomenal level, a quantum discretum and, on the ordinary macrophenomenal level, a community of observers and observational perspectives. In none of this is there any question of overall mechanical determinacy, or entropy, except in those specially delineated, local circumstances to which statistical 'laws', like those of thermodynamics, etc., have been found to apply. In the remainder of other situations, in 'nature in the round' so to speak, the essence of all interaction — especially in our terrestrial environment, is not mechanical interaction but communication between agents, many of which (or whom) enjoy a freedom to deliberate courses of action which, to some extent or other, may materially change the course of a history which otherwise might be probabilistically determined. This capability of intervention, of making independent choices of actions naturally entails responsibility on the part of those individuals.
</p>
<h3 id="viii1-substance-and-perspective">VIII.1 Substance and perspective</h3>
<p>
Now the thing about perspectives is that they are views which are systematically of something which, in itself, is not a perspective. When various observers look at a tower in the distance, every perspective of that tower is different. Yet all may conclude, from a concurrence of those perspectives, with the aid of trigonometry, etc., that the tower has, in itself, a height, breadth, depth and location. This enables us to describe the tower as having an objective existence independently of all the various views of it. Also, since its mass is a part of the earth's mass, it contributes to the angular momentum of the earth as it orbits with regard to the sun and the other bodies of the solar system and beyond. This means that the earth's orbit could not be exactly the same if the tower were an illusion.
</p>
<p>
The same goes for any object‡ which we may legitimately think of as existing in itself whether we see it or not. Such, then, is the objective or real world of commonsense perception, which is so entirely distinct from worlds of illusion and theoretical imagining. That real, objective world of ordinary things, planets, stars and galaxies is the world of which our observations are the perspectives. It is the world we traditionally think of as material or physical. However, as we have seen, in this real, substantial world, there is no single overall space nor single overall time. Each individual bit of matter exists self-sufficiently but never in complete isolation. Each bit of matter exists only in relation to every other bit in the context of a whole whose ultimate parts are continuously but only sporadically (that is, stochastically or indeterminately) linked. Like every other object, the mass and other properties of the tower, including its duration, are measures relative to other objects. For instance, relatively to a spaceship speeding away from or towards the earth, the tower has a mass and duration different from those measures as manifest to a terrestrial observer. There is no mass, motion, position, duration or whatever of any object relative to nothing but itself — that is, in complete isolation. This last, rather obvious, statement defines the essence of relativistic physics.
</p>
<p>
What an object is, therefore, in itself, when no-one is looking at it, is what it is relative to other material objects. This removes any suggestion of the sort of 'subjective idealism' that was expressed in George Berkeley's notoriously subjectivist dictum esse is percipi ('to be is to be perceived'). Objects exist relatively to one another even when there is nothing around that would fit the description of a 'percipient'. This is just plain commonsense.
</p>
<p>
But if our Informational paradigm does not entail subjective idealism, then neither does it entail the opposite view, of absolute objectivism. This is the notion that stems from Democritus, that every ultimate piece of matter (atom) exists self-sufficiently, relative to nothing but itself. All else, according to that view, is dismissed as 'Mind' or, as Democritus called it, 'convention', which does not signify in that Democritan materialistic schema.
</p>
<p>
By complete contrast, in the context of our relationist paradigm, this hard-line division between 'mind' and 'matter', instituted as a basis of Western physics by René Descartes (1596-1650), is obliterated. This removes the bogus dualism of the 'two realities', the problem of connecting which, in Western philosophy prior to the advent of relativity, proved insoluble. All manner of explanations as to how to connect 'mind' and 'matter' as Descartes had conceived them were proposed but were all doomed to failure while the two categories had been defined in that dualistic way. Attempts to see everything as mind fared no better than attempts to see everything as matter. All this made a mockery of the academic Philosophy of the era. If only the philosophers of the time had been able to shed their own historic attachments to dualism, the mentalistic strand of scientific philosophy explored by George Berkeley, David Hume and Immanuel Kant could well have evolved earlier than it did into modern-day relativism. This relativism began to emerge towards the end of the nineteenth century in the form developed by the philosopher-physicist, Ernst Mach, who greatly influenced the thinking of Einstein. Unfortunately, later on, Mach repudiated Einstein's version of relativity because he, Mach, considered it to be incomplete, still tainted by the dualistic approach. This is precisely why we also repudiate Einstein's version of relativity, because its 'velocity' interpretation of $c$ separates the observer inexorably (and needlessly) from the physical world in precisely the way that Descartes imagined!
</p>
<p>
Dispensing with dualism unifies philosophical realism and puts mind and matter into the one and only reality that it makes sense to speak of. Within the context of that one and only reality, mind matters. Moral laws link with physical laws, restoring to society those humane values such as truth, reality, goodness, justice, wisdom,... etc., etc., that were banished by atomic physics and without which our society cannot function.
</p>
<p>
In our new, holistic realism, conscious communication and physical interaction are all part of the same informational package. Matter interacts in terms of quantum bar-codes, while perception does so in terms of communicated perspectives, all within one and the same reality. For instance, one of those perspectives of the substantial tower in the distance might be through the sights of a military field-gun and the tower might be a sacred building temporarily occupied by an enemy. As a soldier in charge of that gun I may be faced with the decision of whether to let the tower stand or to obey a communicated order to fire on it, killing the enemy but reducing the historical building to rubble. That decision, either on my part or that of my commanders, is not part of the 'material' world, yet it has very definite material consequences, so that the classical separation between 'mind' and 'matter' no longer applies.
</p>
<p>
Faced, then, with the reality of these sorts of situations, the old philosophical issue of whether or not there is such a propensity as free will becomes academic. Everyone knows that deliberation, volition and responsibility are realities, in no way reducible to the mechanical motions of atoms.
</p>
<p>
Recognising this is something that distinguishes radically between the Democritan, atomic approach to science and the new information-based, relationist approach in which the material sciences join seamlessly with the humanities. And of course, with real responsibility and real decision-making come unavoidable questions of real morality and, in its wake, unavoidable questions of real religion. This is why, in those talks and seminars which have led to this treatise, questions of this kind that have arisen have been altogether natural and refreshingly naive. They have not been confined, in the usual stylised and stilted way, within the voodoo chalk circles of academic propriety that are so typical of Physics conferences and publications. What would normally be regarded as separate issues of Science and Theology have been run together most naturally and uninhibitedly, just as and when curiosity directs.
</p>
<h3 id="viii2-the-quantum-informational-logos">VIII.2. The quantum-informational logos</h3>
<p>
One of the interesting questions which arose in these discussions was that of whether or not life, consciousness and its associated spiritual values can evolve. What, the questioner asked, does modern science say about this conflict between creation and evolution?
</p>
<p>
But why, one may ask, is it so generally assumed that creation and evolution contradict each other when, logically, they don't? For example, my wife can create a birthday cake by choosing the ingredients and mixing them according to her own recipe. She can then put that mix in the oven and leave it to the purely random processes of heat and chemical action to evolve that cake in the way she intended for the party. Now is there any contradiction between her intention to create the cake according to her purpose and then trusting its evolution to the eminently random processes that take place inside an oven? Surely not!
</p>
<p>
So what's wrong with thinking of some creator™ purposefully choosing the ingredients for life on this planet and then trusting it to evolve in the 'oven' of the sun's radiation? One need not, as some people do, claim to have a personal and intimate knowledge of such a creator. What is clear to commonsense, without involving religion in any way, is that without some premium placed, at its start, on the evolution of life, it would be as unlikely that life would have appeared in this universe by chance as that a birthday cake could be produced in an oven without the intention of the cook. Indeed, any idea that the cake, the birthday party and all the extraneous events leading to it were accidental spin-offs of causal atomic mechanisms is plainly ridiculous.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, nothing can evolve where there is no logical possibility of its doing so. Under no circumstances can a random pile of rubble ever, of itself, evolve into a building, or a billiard ball into a frog. The fanciful idea that monkeys strumming for long enough on typewriters would eventually succeed in producing the works of Shakespeare is pure nonsense since in a random universe, not only would there be nothing to evaluate and recognise that success — to put any premium on its emergence — but also the chances, from instant to instant, of anything like that appearing would be the same as those of its disappearing. There would be nothing to evaluate and store the 'successes'.
</p>
<p>
Any idea of life as we know it emerging by pure chance is therefore incoherent. On the other hand, everyone knows that under the right conditions, a chestnut will almost certainly develop into a tree. Anything that evolution produces was therefore always potentially present in the system of things, otherwise nothing whatever would have happened. The Greek philosopher, Aristotle, called these potentialities 'forms'. Without these forms, he said, nothing can become anything other than whatever it already is. A state of chaos would remain in that state forever. And since there is no information in chaos, then even to think about such a universal state is a contradiction and therefore an extremely unscientific notion.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, it is plain that, being a prerequisite for evolution, while many forms are accidental, many are 'teleological', that is, exhibiting designs or purposes in nature which could never have emerged accidentally. This teleology is an everyday assumption of the life sciences and has steadfastly resisted reduction — other than in pure belief — to the laws of classical physics, hence the disparity between these sciences that prevents unification, as commented at the beginning of this book. A modern replacement for the word 'teleological' is functional, as used by biologists to describe the obvious and unquestioned presence of a goal-seeking propensity among organisms — that is, forms of constitution and behaviour that are clearly designed for future survival of the organism and its descendants.
</p>
<p>
How, then, do these forms and substance interrelate? That's easy. There is no having the one without the other any more than there can be an inside without an outside or an up without a down. Form and substance are correlative — no form without substance and no substance without form. But although form and substance cannot be separated, they can be distinguished. Also, a form can be transferred from one substance to another, as in organic reproduction and replication. What's more, forms can be abstracted. The abstraction and fitting together of pure forms is a propensity of animal foresight. In man, this leads to logic and mathematics, painting and sculpture, to literature and art generally. An architect anticipates, in his mind and on paper, the form of a building; and a bird no less plainly thinks out how best to solve problems of finding food and deciding where best to build its nest. Naturalists provide many glowing examples of this kind of goal-anticipating behaviour right throughout both the animal and vegetable kingdom, which in no way can be explained in terms of classical physical laws.
</p>
<p>
Forms, in this abstracted or purified sense, are what the Greeks called logos, as opposed to physis which they distinguished as 'material substance'. Indeed, 'forms', in a completely abstracted, or idealised sense (which Plato had named 'Ideas' — a move which Aristotle rejected) have been used as a basis for religion. For instance, in the 13th century the Christian Church deified these Forms, or Ideas, in the concept of a disembodied 'Logos', which it identified as part of the 'Holy Trinity'. Now whether or not one accepts that particular religious doctrine, the fact remains that modern information-based science is by no means as hostile to the Christian religion — indeed, any religion — as classical science was. In that case, it has to be said that continuing to oppose religion in the name of 'Science', nowadays, is simply 'Old Hat'. To postulate the existence of an information-transacting deity, to which one may make supplication (in 'prayer' or whatever) is by no means as nonsensical to contemplate in an informational system of things as it was in the traditionally materialistic one.
</p>
<p>
However, regardless of whether or not a Logos (capital el) of forms can be idealised or personified in that way, the existence of a logos (small el) of forms in a purely secular sense cannot be doubted. An information-based science, then, is fundamentally different from classical science in that it cannot be used as a basis for atheism — other than as a belief that is on a par with the most irrational of religious beliefs and superstitions. According to classical science everything begins in a random clattering of atoms which somehow, by sheer luck, produces life in all its variety of construction and interlinking of forms. In a science based on laws of probability instead of laws of mechanics, the calculated probability of life evolving in this way from purely random happenings is nil. The fact, then, that there obviously is life, consciousness and those associated values we call 'spiritual', testifies to the built-in probability that, given enough time, all this would sooner or later emerge. These probabilities that modern science calls 'quantum potentials' are virtually the forms or potentialities of Aristotle. They are also the measures on which modern Information Technology is based.
</p>
<p>
These (secular) forms, or potentials are, of course, not linked in any mechanical or in any other causally determined way. In a logical argument, for instance, the sequence of antecedent to consequent, as signified by the word 'ergo' (or 'therefore') is not a time-sequence as in material processes. Unlike ordinary cause-effect sequences, abstract logical antecedent-consequent relations — which, as we have seen, may have material effects — can proceed either forward or backwards in our minds, which means that they can be retrospectively reviewed and changed without any of the absurdities that this would imply if they were ordinary temporal processes. In other words, unlike the category of material substance, the category of forms, or logos, as abstracted in human reason, is not a 'universe' but a pluriverse of independent and often competing processes, involving agents with wills and intentions of their own. And the knock-on effect of this can be physically real, as we have seen in the example of the tower.
</p>
<p>
But if instead of a universe we have a pluriverse, and instead of a continuum a discretum, then in what sense can we describe this information-based approach as 'holistic', as resembling a hologram? The word 'hologram' derives from the Greek, holos, meaning complete, or whole. So in what sense can this informational discretum be suitably described as a hologram?
</p>
<p>
The answer is that insofar as a hologram is a whole, comprised of variously interacting parts and of which there are various independent and relative perspectives, it provides an appropriate model of nature as modern relativistic quantum physics describes it. This wholeness of nature lies in its principles of overall conservation, as applied to measures of angular momentum, action, and so on, according to which these quantities can neither emerge from nothing nor lapse into nothing. However, while it is true to say that these quantities are 'universally' conserved, we must remember that 'universal' has two meanings. For instance, one may say that angular momentum is conserved in every action that takes place, so that when a pair of atoms interact, the one atom loses a quantum of angular momentum and the other gains precisely that same amount. In that case, in the system involving just those two atoms, the angular momentum is absolutely conserved: And if this is the case with every other atomic interaction that takes place, then one might say that angular momentum is conserved 'universally' according to one meaning of that word, namely, 'applicable to all cases'. However, that is not the same as saying that the angular momentum is conserved simultaneously between all atoms everywhere, according to the other definition of 'universal', meaning 'present or occurring everywhere, all at once'. If that were the case, then for one atom to interact with another would be to interact with all atoms everywhere. To move one thing would be to move everything, the consequence of which would be an Eleatic stasis.§
</p>
<p>
This distinction is subtle but significant. In saying that angular momentum is conserved 'universally' we do not mean that it is conserved 'monolithically', or everywhere at the same instant. We mean that angular momentum is conserved in every single case of atomic interaction, which is not quite the same thing (such being the nuances of the language we are constrained to use).
</p>
<p>
The same goes for the wholeness of a hologram, all parts of which are connected individually without necessarily being seen as a whole. However, in a hologram as ordinarily conceived, there is an overall design to the system, hence a designer, an overseer, a creator or 'presiding intelligence' which is outside the system, (a Deus ex Logica rather than a Deus ex Machina). Now whether there is the same sort of overall designer and 'presiding intelligence' in the World at large is a question that, in seminars on this subject, has been raised in that same uninhibitedly philosophical and logical, non-academic manner that has been described in the Preface. Some feel that the notion of an overall cosmic will and intelligence is inconsistent with any idea of moral freedom and autonomy. Others prefer the idea of a bifurcation of intelligences into good and evil, personified in Christian theology as 'God versus Satan'. Others again prefer to think of these evaluations and personifications as no more than conventionalised reflections of human likes and dislikes. There is, they say, no overall presiding intelligence but merely a conflict of wills and intentions between multifarious agencies, in a Darwinian 'survival-of-the-fittest' scenario.
</p>
<p>
But be that as it may, the revolutionary trends in modern physics, away from mechanistic, or atomic, ways of thinking towards these more holistic and relativistic, information-based modes puts an altogether different complexion on things. It places these humane, moral and spiritual issues — or, rather, replaces them — on a different footing from that of those long eras when human values remained in conflict with mechanistic science, the conflict which has undoubtedly led to the morally confused society we have today. With that old source of antagonism between 'mental' and 'material' finally removed in favour of a commonsense-logical merger of science and the humanities, perhaps the current wildest excesses of irrationality in both sectors may be curbed.
</p>
<p>
We end this section by saying that although it is the aim of this present small volume to explore the logical implications of the holistic paradigm as far as logic takes us, we should remember that, as has well been said, there are truths that without being contrary to logic are nevertheless beyond logic. As Hamlet says, in Shakespeare's play: 'There are more things 'twixt heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamed of in your philosophy.'
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, then, the best we can expect of even the most meticulously logical argument, is that although logic can never be taken as an oracle of truth, at least it is the only thing that can be safely relied upon to eliminate error. And what else but to eliminate error can be the common interest of society in all sectors of natural science and human reason?
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ix-theological-and-social-implications" class="chapter-title">IX. Theological and Social Implications</h2>
<p>
'God does not play dice', said Einstein, to which his friend, Max Planck, replied, 'Albert, you should stop telling God what he should and shouldn't do.'
</p>
<p>
What 'God' does or does not do is something we have no possible way of knowing, not least because we have no solid definition of what 'God' means. Even professed atheists fall foul of this fallacy. In a lesson on Liberal Studies at a Technical College, I once asked the students, 'How many atheists are there in this class?' All the hands went up. 'What does atheism mean?' I asked them. 'It means, they replied, 'that we don't believe in God'. 'Describe to me, then, I said, 'the God you don't believe in,' The answers they gave were completely bizarre. Descriptions ranged from that of a Zeus-like figure, sitting on a cloud, dispensing punishments with strokes of lightning, to that of some kind of 'Ghost' floating around spying on us and knowing what we are all thinking and doing. Not the least strange among these responses was that of the student who said, 'I'm not going to believe in God. F*** him!'
</p>
<p>
I then wrote on the board, I don't believe in Wuggies. 'Do you agree with that?' I asked. 'Well, how do we know,' said a spokesman, 'unless we know what a "Wuggie" is?' 'Precisely!' I replied, and left them to think about it.
</p>
<p>
Evidently, to declare either that one believes or does not believe in X is nonsense, unless one can know precisely what 'X' stands for, and since one can never know precisely what 'God' stands for, then what possible sense can there be in saying that one either believes or disbelieves in such a being? According to the Oxford English Dictionary, 'God' is the 'Supreme being, Creator and Ruler of the Universe.' But if, as we have reasoned in previous chapters, there is no such thing as a 'universe' but only a pluriverse or polyverse of independent, free-acting and often conflicting individual agencies, then what is there for anything to be a 'Supreme Creator' of and 'Ruler over'? If, as Voltaire put it, 'God is present everywhere... but everywhere where there is something, not where there is not', then insofar as many of these 'somethings' are separate and distinct, free agents with wills and intentions of their own, what sort of logically coherent idea of such a 'Supreme Being' can we sensibly construct?
</p>
<p>
The fact, then, of there being so many conflicting wills and intentions seems to contradict any notion of an Overall Presiding Will and Intention directing and coordinating the actions of these multifarious free agents. However, there are, in nature, organisms that share a common purpose. Ants in a colony and bees in hive, as well as flocks of birds and shoals of fish, are sometimes observed by naturalists to act together as one in the evident interests of group survival. Observing this, we might judge that there is some altogether inexplicable 'telepathic' contact between these individual organisms. Yet nothing has ever been observed to travel in between these individuals to make a connection.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, it is plain that organisms communicate by physically detectable means. Ants lay and follow chemical trails, birds and other animals communicate both behaviourally and vocally, land-animals do so with vibrations in air and the ground, as do aquatic creatures in water. In all these cases, the means of communication is physically detectable and identifiable, so that there is no mystery to contemplate on that score. Consider, for instance, an army general urging his men into battle. In this case, a single individual, by visual and audio information may be the source of concerted action on the part of many other individuals, so that the will of one becomes the will of many. All this is obvious; just plain commonsense. Where the mystery arises is when we try to explain the goal-directedness of these concerted actions in classical mechanistic terms. In the context of our non-mechanistic, information-based physics, all that mystery disappears completely. This is because, by its very nature, information is goal-directed.¶
</p>
<p>
Volitional autonomy, then, among individuals does not necessarily entail conflict. Wills and intentions may be concerted in the manner described, that is, by some coordinator, such as an orchestra conductor, an orator like Winston Churchill or Adolph Hitler, or by behavioural exemplars such as a Jesus or a Mahomet. From where, it may be asked, do these sorts of people obtain their power? Not from some supernatural 'spiritual' influence floating around in the 'imaginary spaces' that Voltaire talks about. From where, then? Where else but from other individuals, from mothers, fathers, teachers and other social influencers as one advances from birth into adulthood — from all the information one imbibes from these and other sources. Not least among these sources is nature in the round, experiences of which an individual may contemplate, uniquely in his or her own right aside from any social conditioning. Lone scientists and explorers may discover things that do not fit any traditional category of description or anticipation — such as, for instance, Copernicus's heretical discovery that it was the sun, not the earth, that was the centre of motion of the whole planetary system. Such discoveries involve a continual process of adjustment of our conventional idea-systems so as to keep them in accord with nature, in what is customarily called 'the search for natural truth and reality'. To think the opposite, that natural truth and reality must conform to our conventions, is plainly absurd.
</p>
<h3 id="ix1-there-is-no-truth-but-only-opinion">IX.1 'There is no truth but only opinion'</h3>
<p>
But of course, in this sophistic society of ours there are many who do not believe in objective truth and reality. In another Liberal Studies lesson, I wrote on the board:


'There is no such thing as truth but only opinion,'


I then asked class after class if they thought the statement was true. Three hundred or so students, in turn — barring none — answered that it was. I then asked these classes whether the answer they had given was really true or only their opinion. It is not too much to say that I was astounded at how many, quizzed in that way, were unaware of the contradiction involved in insisting that the statement was true.
</p>
<p>
As a matter of plain logic, to claim it as true that there is no such thing as truth is a contradiction and therefore necessarily false. And, logically, the negative of a statement that is necessarily false is necessarily true. This does not mean that we have to know what 'The Truth' is. All we can be sure of is that there is truth — simply because to deny it is a contradiction.
</p>
<p>
The same goes for reality. If nothing was real, then there could be nothing which, in comparison, could be identified as illusion. But there obviously is illusion. Every time we find that we are deluded or fooled into thinking or perceiving something that turns out to be false, we are discovering something more real. Seeking for the 'Ultimate Reality' may well seem an endless metaphysical quest, to be scorned by sophisticates of modern science and philosophy. However, for these people to assume that there is no such reality is to imply that reality and illusion are objectively undifferentiable, a possibility which is negated by the very existence of science and philosophy.
</p>
<p>
Admittedly, then, while it might be too much to describe either science or philosophy as a 'search for truth', in both cases, sophistry is avoided by a dictum such as, 'Although I don't know what "The Truth" is, I sure as hell know what is not!' In this way, truth and reality are sufficiently clearly and objectively defined to ensure the continued need for science and philosophy in human society — in opposition, if necessary, to the demands of social convention. This means that there are always individuals who will refuse to go along with convention — 'along with the herd', as most others do. Social conformity for its own sake can therefore never have been the overriding concern of human society. Indeed, in so many instances, pressures towards conformity have proved antagonistic to a community's very survival. Due to an over-concern with social conformity, whole cultures may stultify and die. (One thinks, for instance, of the Medieval Church in the face of nascent science, of Hitler's design for the Aryan race, Marxism in Russia... etc.) At the cutting edge, therefore, of all human evolution and survival on this planet, there has to be at least some provision for truth and reality to be pursued for their own sake, as ends-in-themselves. What provides for this continued need for adaptation to nature is the natural curiosity that is possessed by the higher orders of animals in proportion to their intelligence. In man, this curiosity, or drive for truth, often overrides all other considerations, and may run counter to all prospects of social acceptance and acclaim for the individual concerned. And what is certain is that without these asocial — and often antisocial — excursions on the parts of its individuals, human society could never have existed in the first place. For instance, what the Medieval Church regarded as the greatest heresy on the part of Galileo has turned out to have been essential for the evolution of our modern society, to the extent (ironically) that the Church which had threatened to liquidate him eventually had to 'forgive' him — posthumously, of course. One might say, therefore, that to have its proportion of 'heretics' is as essential to the health of humanity as a whole as for there to be at least some independently functioning individuals such as scouts in colonies of ants and bees.
</p>
<h3 id="ix2-the-objectivity-of-moral-evaluations">IX.2. The objectivity of moral evaluations</h3>
<p>
And if this is the case with truth and reality, then what about the other verities? What about goodness and justice, for instance? Are these also, like truth and reality, ends to be pursued objectively in their own right, or are they no more than social conventions?
</p>
<p>
But, as we have already seen, without these focuses on ends beyond itself, society would naturally disintegrate. For it to survive by nothing but its own efforts would be like a drowning man trying to survive by tugging at his own hair. Besides, saying that these verities are no more than relative to each of us, as persons and societies, does not deny the objectivity of their existence. For instance, in the above section VIII.1 page 62 we read:


When various observers look at a tower in the distance, every perspective of that tower is different. Yet all may concur, from a community of those perspectives... that the tower has, in itself, a height, breadth, depth and location. This enables us to describe the tower as having an objective existence independently of all the various views of it.
</p>
<p>
Can the same objectivity be claimed on behalf of evaluations such as Truth, Reality, Goodness, Justice and Beauty? In the context of our holistic way of thinking, the traditional, hard-and-fast, dualistic distinction between material and formal (concrete and abstract) no longer applies, which means that such perspectival objectivity as applies to things like towers and so on may also apply in the same way to those other evaluations. During what has been called the 'Golden Age of Greece', these sorts of evaluations, upon which their culture was based — and which still serve as a basis for modern cultures such as ours — were as objectively defined as any 'tower in the distance'. The sculpture of that era, for instance, in its expression of the perfection of the human body and the ideal of form and balance in its architecture and so on, provided for them a standard of beauty for future generations to emulate. Aristotle's Logic provided the criterion for discerning truth from mere opinion and delusion that still applies today. His science also provided the ideal of an objective or natural reality as a focus for critical observation and measure that led to modern science. In the notion of the Greek areté (virtue) we have the objective ideal of a moral Good as applied to individual behaviour, and in the overall balance of these things we have the ideal of personal and social justice.
</p>
<p>
However, not all cultures are based on these Greek standards. For instance, an African ideal of beauty may differ quite radically from that of the Greeks. In Asia the standards of perfection exemplified in the statues of the Buddha and in the architecture of the Buddhist temples are hardly comparable with those of the Greek gods and the Parthenon. Yet these cultures are never so alien to one another as to share no similarities whatsoever in their ideals, For instance, those ideals that proved essential to the Greek culture have their parallels in other cultures, even those that have evolved separately and independently. And the fact that all these cultural ideals are inter-interpretable gives promise, even if only potentially, of a global unification and objectifying of these ideals for the sake of mankind in general.
</p>
<p>
Does this potential for the objectifying of these ideals, then, make them real? The tower in the distance is real enough, although there had to be a time when it existed as no more than an idea in the minds of its architects and planners. The same can be said of any system such as that of the network of our modern institutions, like our transport and other systems, commercial and industrial. How could these things ever have 'evolved' without being preceded, in some way or another, by ideas and a logical processing of them in the minds of human individuals? To think that they could somehow 'emerge' on their own, purely mechanically, without individual human agency, is to embrace some kind of mythology.
</p>
<p>
In any case, are the ideals of beauty, goodness, justice and so on which are so essential to the creation and health of these institutions any less real than the piles of materials out of which they are constructed? Are they any less real for having once existed nowhere but in the minds of their founders? Insofar as these ideals point necessarily beyond us individually, in our lives and ordinary mundane concerns — even, in some cases, beyond our political institutions (as when these latter become corrupt, for instance, in the judgements of some of their members) they are, by definition, superhuman. However, as their consequences may attest, many of these ideals are illusory. But they cannot all be illusory, otherwise no society or community would ever be possible. Many of the ideals by which our social institutions are generally judged good or bad are therefore judged in accordance with criteria that do not emerge from within those institutions themselves. History shows that these criteria by which institutions are judged may be more recognisable to their individual members at the time than to the custodians of the social norms and standards. As is well known, this may be to the extent, sometimes, that these far-sighted individuals may be prepared to sacrifice their very lives in opposition to the political status quo, as Socrates did in taking poison rather than being forced to conform, and as Giordano Bruno did in choosing to be burned rather than renounce his support for the views of Copernicus.
</p>
<h3 id="ix3-the-goal-directedness-of-morality">IX.3 The goal-directedness of morality</h3>
<p>
To what ends or goals, then, do these ideals point, since it cannot be to the near-sighted here-and-now of comfortable conformity within a society? Do they signify the existence of some superhuman will and intention that prompts us to seek goals beyond those of purely personal pleasure and social survival?
</p>
<p>
Evidences of such motivation abound among organisms in general as in the sacrifices made by parents for their offspring. (Mechanistic explanations of this phenomenon as due to what has been called 'the selfish gene' sometimes ignore the fact that the forward-looking or, goal-seeking propensities imputed to these genes have no parallel whatsoever in the world that is described in terms of our traditional 'physical laws'.)
</p>
<p>
Is there some super-coordinated ideal, an ideal of all ideals, some super end-aim which lies beyond human comprehension? If so, then, at best, it is something which, in its entirety, can only be guessed at. And if it exists, to whatever extent it may, then it has to be something manifesting itself from within us — within all organisms, perhaps — not something hovering in space, either now or in some mystically imagined 'future'.
</p>
<h3 id="ix4-the-absolute-necessity-of-faith-and-belief">IX.4 The absolute necessity of faith and belief</h3>
<p>
However, things we may have no hope of ever comprehending are not, for that reason, necessarily non-existent. I may not know what is around that next corner or over that next horizon, but I know that there is something there, although I may never actually see it. Not to believe that would incapacitate me.
</p>
<p>
At every waking moment, therefore, faith and belief are an integral part of our ordinary perception and experience. To confine all assurances of reality to what we directly and presently sense, as George Berkeley sought to do in his dictum esse is percipi ('To be is to be perceived'), have proved untenable. Another inseparable part of our ordinary integrated perception is the knowledge that one's own consciousness and intelligence cannot be all there is. To assume that other intelligences are no more than figments of one's own imagination would be to court insanity.
</p>
<p>
In the same way, we have to believe in a residual class of intelligence in nature which, regardless of what we might call it, is superior not only to our own intelligence but also to that of mankind as a whole. As we have seen, if no-one in a society recognised this, then that society would become completely moribund. This does not mean that we have to know everything about that super intelligence in order to know that it exists. We may sensibly accept its existence along with the knowledge that whatever it may be in itself is altogether beyond our understanding. We may even believe in its benevolence in the face of a nature that is 'red in tooth and claw'. In this way, we may share the universal 'religion' which is common to all life-forms on this planet, as expressed in the well-worn saying: "Where there's life, there's hope'. This is what has been variously described as the 'will to survive', or the 'survival instinct'. Regardless of what we may call it, this behavioural 'optimism' in the face of all that is hostile to life, sustains all living things and without it they would just lie down and die or else have remained, from the beginning, as uniformly inert as pebbles.
</p>
<p>
Should we, then, deify these things which are incomprehensible to us and in which, at best, we can only believe? The plain fact is that, in very large numbers, throughout the whole of human history, people have done so and still do. Does this, then, make these idealistic projections objectively real? Obviously not, because we may believe in and deify just about anything. It cannot be that the mere fact that we can imagine something gives it objective existence. Beliefs, like all perspectives, are subject to rational analysis. This is not the same as saying that nothing exists unless it is proved by logical reason. It is well said that there are truths that are beyond but never contrary to reason. The same applies to all other ideals such as beauty, goodness and justice, none of which is exempt from rational evaluation in the interests of social weal and survival.
</p>
<p>
But, of course, there is always the question of evil. Over a drink in a pub, I once asked a professional psychiatrist whether he believed in a God. He replied, reflectively and with feeling, 'No, but my work has certainly made me believe in a Devil!' Was this just a wry statement or was it an incipient concession to religion? It was, in any event, a statement made by a working psychiatrist, not a theologian. Nevertheless, for anything that may be positively conceived, its negative is also implied. The one makes no sense without the other (e.g., wherever there's an up there is always a down). The Greek ideal of areté was that of the virtuous man in a virtuous society, this being the ideal of both social and individual goodness. Any mismatch between those two in the matter of virtue, due to default on the part of the one or the other, was therefore the opposite of good; and any deliberate intention in that negative direction on the part of either the individual or the society was evil. That, basically, is what the word 'evil' signifies today.
</p>
<p>
The same goes for every one of those other ideals that have been mentioned. The signature of evil is plainly the negative of corporate social and individual health and harmony, and the fact that so many of us judge the actions of others to be evil implies that we harbour at least an incipient belief in an integrated social/individual good. This belief, however narrowly defined in social terms, may be very deeply ingrained — perhaps innate, genetically 'wired-in', as it were). Taboos against incest, for instance, are arguably not mere conventions, since incest also transpires to be physically deleterious to the health and survival of a family line. We may find, therefore, that the actions of some people automatically disgust and dismay us — in some cases, physically sicken us. These automatic feelings, regardless of whether we admit or deny them, betoken our leanings towards this belief or that. And never was there anyone alive and sane who was not morally offended by anything at all. The question of whether, or to what extent, there is some kind of objective common factor of morality, that is to say, some evaluation to be found in humanity generally as to what is morally acceptable or offensive, is a question which cannot be answered by fiat. Philosophers throughout history, from Plato to Nietzsche, from Thomas Hobbes to Karl Marx, Jeremy Bentham and Mao Zedong, have sought to provide well-meant theoretical solutions for the good of society as they saw it, all too many of which, unfortunately, have proved disastrous in their implementation.
</p>
<p>
So how, if at all, can we objectify the 'power of evil'? It might help if we recognise that there are two fairly distinct forms of life. One of these is the sort of life which is self-sufficient, which evolves and survives in its own right. Organisms which thrive on the processing of pristine, inorganic matter by utilising energy from sources such as the sun, from volcanoes and so on, are the primary form of life. If life had evolved on no basis other than that, then that might be regarded as the epitome of 'goodness', of wholeness or health for that life form and even for life in general. On the other hand, there are life-forms whose existence has to be parasitic on life that is already there. In general, these parasitic, or predatory life-forms (of which we, the human species, are an example) provide the negating or opposing principle of life which, in our common language we indicate with words like 'bad', 'ill', 'evil' or some other linguistic variant with the same or similar meaning.
</p>
<p>
An example of this polarity is provided by the modern phenomenon of the INTERNET. In its inception, this was a perfect means of communication throughout the planet, in which any individual, anywhere on the globe, would be able to communicate with any other individual anywhere else. The situation presented was an ideal of that which was provided by the stoa in Athens, where all the citizens could be gathered within earshot of the speaker — somewhat like the provision of the soapbox for orators in Hyde Park. But what then happened with the INTERNET reveals what happens with life in general. Any flaw in the system is exploited by what might be described as 'the opposition'. When this system of human communication began it was potentially perfect. But no sooner was that system up and running than 'viruses', 'worms' and so on, began to appear which revealed that there were deficiencies in the system. These deficiencies were exploited simply because they were there. Viruses were developed because they 'fell into the cracks', as it were, of the system on the principle that, sooner or later, whatever can happen will. Arguably, these threats provide a service for the system in highlighting its deficiencies and in the correcting of which the health and strength of the system overall may be improved. In that case, what is 'good' for the system is for it, ultimately, to prevail against these attacks on it, and what is bad, or 'evil' is for it to succumb into extinction.
</p>
<p>
The 'triumph of evil', in these terms, would be, of course, for all such systems and organisms to disappear off the face of the earth — 'for the evil to overcome the good' in our customary language. And who is to say, other than in hindsight, what is good or bad for a society or for the individuals in it? What good, for instance, might have been created by people with evil intent, or what evils might have been created by those of good intent? ('The road to hell', it is said, 'is paved with good intentions'.) Philosophers have wrestled with these questions for millennia without coming up with any satisfactory answer.
</p>
<h3 id="ix5-faith-and-reason">IX.5 Faith and reason</h3>
<p>
However, one thing is certain. This is that the new holistic, information-based science does not preclude the possibility of such a remote end-aim as a world-morality in the way the old one did with its built-in classically 'scientific' scepticism and cynicism about the reality of anything beyond atoms and atomic mechanisms. The difference, as someone has put it, is between dealing with nature as a Machine or dealing with it as a Mind — or, at any rate something more in the category of 'mental' (i.e. informational) than 'mechanical'.
</p>
<p>
This radically different scientific approach to nature is socially ground-breaking. Not only does it leave room for religious faith but, in connecting scientific reason with religious faith, it also automatically connects religious faith with scientific reason. This closes the gap between science and religion as these are traditionally conceived. The advantage this offers is to curb those excesses of irrationality which characterise what are plainly the wildest, most dogmatic and dangerous of religious faiths. In fact, this (potentially) seamless connection between a rational science and a rational religion puts the two into the same logical category of anti-dogmatic natural philosophy. This should be as open-ended in its theories about nature at its microphysical boundaries as about nature on the macroscale. This philosophical open-endedness proffers the best antidote to the sort of dogmatism that presumes to know, absolutely and unshakably, 'the Mind of God' on all levels of human experience.
</p>
<h3 id="ix6-reason-the-antidote-to-dogma">IX.6 Reason, the antidote to dogma</h3>
<p>
Now usually we associate the kind of 'God's-eye-view' dogmatism described above with priests and other advocates of the various religions. In fact, however, the worst of these dogmatists are, very often, scientists. For instance, what many scientists do in the name of 'science' is implicit religion, which is often all the more dogmatic for being undeclared and unexamined (witness, for instance, Einstein's above-quoted statement: 'God does not play dice'). The worst offenders in this way are those mathematicians and cosmologists who, in their minds, encompass everything within what they imagine is 'The Universe' and then go about describing the mathematical intricacies of this creation of theirs whilst remaining completely unaware that it resides nowhere but inside their own heads. One of the forms this scientific religion, or deism (called 'the God of the Scientists') usually takes is tacitly to presume that there is an overall, universal presence with which they can identify and relative to which everything happens everywhere all at the same time. This is an idea that has characterised classical science since its very inception and which militates, in the name of "Dissidence'™ against any true understanding of modern relativistic and quantum physics. Along with this notion of a universal and absolute 'God's-eye-view', goes a belief in the existence of a universal 'present moment' in which time 'ticks away' metaphysically, at the same rate everywhere, regardless of what happens to clocks and other time processes in systems which move relatively to one another. This is as mystical and unsupported a belief, in science, as may be found among any 'unscientific' religious sect.
</p>
<p>
The upshot, then, of our connecting up of religious belief and logical reason should be to unify, to an altogether unprecedented extent, the sciences and the humanities. This is within a rational, open-ended and anti-dogmatic natural philosophy in which all our various human concerns are united in the way that only reason can achieve. It should also restore the missing link between the phalanx presented by self-interest groups such as politics, commerce and industry, on the one hand and, on the other hand, the sorts of concerns for the preservation of the environment and man's proper place in it that motivates more and more altruistic 'naturalist' groups. It offsets the terminal, built-in cynicism of classical mechanistic physics according to which the 'universe' is no more than a machine. Since there can be no morality in a machine, then a human society based on nothing but a 'mechanistic' ethos is consigned sooner or later to moral self-destruction. There are disturbing signs that this may already be the path of sheer irrationality on which our modern world-society is set. One cannot help noticing a definite 'lemming-like' tendency towards such destruction among the escalating suicide groups at this present time of writing as in the sort of lunatic 'logic' whereby A kills C,D,E... etc., including even himself, in order to spite B; also the escapism which makes so many young people nowadays prefer languishing in a realm of drug-induced hallucination to living in what they see as an irrational and nonsensical world — a world in which, if it were rational, they might otherwise be healthily and happily engaged. At this rate, without any true moral 'north' by which our modern society might set its ethical compass — other than the illusion presented by rich celebrities who are as confused as anyone (and perhaps more so than most) about morality and reason — what has been called 'the human race' may now have become a race between Reason and a dinosaur-like extinction.
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="x-summary" class="chapter-title">X. Summary</h2>
<p>
The essential difference between modern science and traditional science is its radical, although not yet completed, Copernican-like shift away from thinking of nature in the way that an all-seeing presence might be presumed to see it towards thinking of it as a vast manifold of finite observational or relative, point-centred perspectives. What we call 'Science' is no mystically inspired 'God's-eye-view' of things. All our knowledge of the world is obtained via our finite senses and instrument-systems, and this knowledge is what we construct by means of our human faculty of reason, albeit in communication with other human observers and their instrument-systems. Science is therefore an essentially human undertaking, expressed in human language and processed by human logic and human mathematics. Losing sight of this fundamental principle has led classical physicists and cosmologists to assume that, somehow, they were studying 'the universe' when, in fact, they were doing no more than studying their own finite and fallible sensations and ideas.
</p>
<p>
Relativity disabuses us of that long-inculcated, 'God's-eye-view' presumption of classical science. For some people this loss can be traumatic. We are so used to thinking of the time by which we live our lives as the same everywhere. We never actually say it, but the tacit assumption is that the time by which we measure our living-times, between our birthdays, between our heartbeats, our cell-division rates and so on — one's age, in effect — is the same everywhere, not just throughout our immediate neighbourhood and planet but also throughout the stars and into the whole galactic and inter-galactic beyond.
</p>
<p>
But what warrant did we ever have for such an assumption? Time is what we measure with clocks. What else, indeed, can time possibly be? Normally, we don't think of these clock-rates as varying with motion, but Römer showed that they do. He discovered that as clocks travel away from or towards us (in his case, the clock-movement being that of Jupiter's satellite) they are seen to lose or gain time in the ratio of one second for every three-hundred million metres. This affects all clocks in the same way, although, until Römer, no-one had noticed this.
</p>
<p>
Einstein was the first to realise what this meant for physical measures in general. Time is one of the basic physical dimensions, and so are length and mass. Moreover, these measures are all inter-dependent in defining the existence of a physical object. So if time varies observationally, then so do those other dimensions of physical objects. This relativises our whole conception of matter and material objectivity. (Undoubtedly, this is why so many people have a phobia against accepting the theory of relativity, because they feel, deep down, that what they think of as this 'loss of Objectivity' in science would be traumatic.)
</p>
<p>
However, as we have seen, there is no real loss of objectivity implied by relativity. More serious as a barrier to accepting relativity is an amazing mistake made, most surprisingly, by Einstein himself. Having established, mathematically, the relativity of length, time and mass, he over-interpreted Römer's length-time constant $c$ as 'the speed of light in space'. So light, which is, in itself, the information from which all our knowledge of space and time stems was made to travel in that very same space and time that is projected out of it. In other words, space-time was made to travel in itself, a completely circular and therefore fallacious assumption.
</p>
<p>
If only Einstein had settled for accepting $c$ in Bondi's way as a pure dimensional constant, modern science might have been disabused of its classical, God's-eye-view presumption of ubiquity and re-located, cleanly and clearly on a truly relativistic, observational basis.** The result would undoubtedly have been socially unsettling, as all revolutions inevitably are, but at least we would have known where we stand. We would have been relieved of all the tortuous, mind-bending jiggery-pokery that goes with 'relativity' as now commonly understood. 'Relative' would have simply meant what it always meant: 'relative to', or 'in relation to' as opposed to 'absolute', or 'self-sufficient'. The conceptual switch from absolutism to observationism made by Einstein's mentor, Mach, in the phenomenalist tradition of Berkeley, Hume and Kant, could then have been achieved at a stroke. Light (in its total spectral range from the deepest infra-red to the farthest ultra-violet and gamma) would have been observational information, nothing more nor less. Space would be what is projected out of that information, and so would time, with all other physical dimensions and measures following suit. Science would eventually have come 'down to earth' from its theoretical realms apart, to become re-united with commonsense and the humanities generally. The 'Great Machine' of classical physics would have disappeared and been replaced by an Informational System answering more to the description of a vast computer or hologram. The classical 'Universe' would have been replaced by a Manifold of interacting and intercommunicating agents, and any overall intelligence would have to be conceived as a superhuman Communicator that is directly involved in nature, not remote from it as in the deistic concept of a transcendental Machine-Designer. Any such superhuman agency would have to work in and through Man and his fellow organisms. In other words, if there is a God, then, as Voltaire wrote:††
</p>
<p>
> (He) is present everywhere... but everywhere where there is something, not where there is not. To be present in nothing seems to me a contradiction in terms, an absurdity... I will not set up the throne of God in imaginary spaces.

\* An algorithm is a problem which is amenable to solution by a logical arithmetical or computational procedure that if correctly applied ensures the solution of the problem. Compare heuristic, or open-ended.

† This proposed explanation is currently being explored in discussions held at Keele University and has so far been found to be at least quantitatively plausible. A joint paper on this will be produced in due course.

‡ This also includes the infamous 'Schrödinger's Cat' which, out of sight of any human observer, was supposed to be in a mixed state of being neither wholly alive nor wholly dead, due to a 'superposition of quantum states'. This is pure nonsense because, whether or not it is observed, the existence of the cat in one or the other of those states is definitely assured by its connection not only with the box but also with the whole environment of the box and the ancillary apparatus. If the cat were to move, for instance (as live cats typically do even by breathing) the effects of that movement would be definitely detectable in one way or another outside the box, as, for instance, by its swinging on some thread on which it might be suspended.

¶ For A to be able to inform B, A has to be in possession of some bit of information which B does not possess. Until the information is passed to B, it is therefore in B's future as an aim or 'goal' of the transaction.

\<em>\</em> See, e.g., the Natural Philosophy Alliance (NPA) and the 'Commonsense Science' group, based in the USA. Both of these groups are dedicated to a belief in temporal non-locality. They contend that it was reprehensible, indeed, heretical, of Einstein to forsake the traditional God's-eye-view of time being the same everywhere.

‡‡ In the Preface to his <em>Prinzipien der physikalischen Optik</em>, Ernst Mach (1921), wrote: 'I gather from the publications which have reached me and especially from my correspondence, that I am becoming regarded as the forerunner of relativity... I must, however, as assuredly disclaim to be a forerunner of the Relativists as I personally reject the atomistic doctrine of the present-day school.'

§§ 'What about virus particles?' someone asks, 'Can we impute to these a 'survival instinct', or "will to survive"?' Certainly, we cannot ascribe to these particles any individual intention to do what they do in invading living organisms. Their behaviour, however, in mutating and, in all sorts of other ways, resisting attempts to eradicate them cannot be accounted for in traditionally mechanistic terms. This forces biologists to describe their behaviour in a language that, regardless of how inept it may be in many respects, is at least non-mechanistic and more in keeping with that of 'will' and 'intention' than in the sort of language that is used to describe the behaviour of purely mechanical particles.
